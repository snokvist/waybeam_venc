## [0.59.0] - 2026-07-26

New `GET /api/v1/snapshot.pgm` endpoint returns a grayscale frame as a binary
P5 PGM — the luma plane of an uncompressed NV12 frame, with no JPEG
encode/decode step. It rides the existing `snapshot.enabled` gate and the
snapshot subsystem mutex, so `.jpg` and `.pgm` share one switch and never run
concurrently. Implemented on both backends: Star6E taps VPE port1, Maruko taps
SCL port3.

On Star6E the grab programs a short-lived VPE **port1** tap, drains exactly one
frame (`MI_SYS_ChnOutputPortGetBuf`, mirroring the detector tap in
`star6e_ipu_yolo.c`), and tears the tap back down — resetting the user output
depth before `MI_VPE_DisablePort` on every exit path. It deliberately does not
touch port0: a user frame queue may only be registered on a port with no
downstream hardware bind, and port0 is bound to the H.265 encoder (1:N with the
MJPEG channel), where registering one makes the kernel SCL run user output
tasks alongside the bind and trips a hard `BUG` in
`_MI_SYS_IMPL_AllocBufDefaultPolicy` on the `vpe0_P0_MAIN` worker — stalling
the live encode path and, on some runs, resetting the board.

Because port1 is the single second scaler output, the capture takes it through
the `star6e_vpe_ports` arbiter: stab framing and NPU detection own that tap for
a whole run, so a capture attempted while either is active returns `409`
(`snapshot_gray_busy`) instead of reprogramming the tap underneath them. Tap
geometry starts from the configured snapshot size and caps the long side at
1280 px (aspect-preserved, width 16-aligned); PGM is self-describing, so
consumers read the real dimensions from the header. Capture failure is
non-fatal — the endpoint serves an error and the encode path is unaffected.

Maruko follows the same shape on i6c primitives. Every SCL output already has
an owner — port0 is the main H.265 output (RING, 1:1), port1 carries the bound
MJPEG channel, port2 is the stab tap — so the grayscale tap uses **port3**, the
NPU detector's, arbitrated by the new `maruko_scl_ports` module so a capture
loses to a running detector instead of reprogramming its tap mid-inference. The
i6c MI_SYS entry points take a leading `u16 soc_id` and the port is configured
through `SetPortConfig` with an explicit crop window, which the pipeline now
publishes via `venc_jpeg_set_gray_crop()`.

Ships the on-device consumer under `tools/qr/`: `qr_decode.c` (vendored quirc,
ISC) decodes a QR code from a P5 PGM — with a mirror-flip retry (decodes
flipped codes), overlapping-tile and half-scale passes (small codes in a large
frame), a light-denoise fallback (noisy captures), and one inverted pass
(light-on-dark codes) — and `qr_boot_action.sh`
polls the
endpoint for the first 15 s of runtime and, on a `cmd=pair;gs=…;psk=…` payload,
applies a waybeam-link RF pairing key from a ground-station QR code. Trust is
by proximity: whoever holds a QR in front of the camera during the boot window
can pair. The link-apply step is a marked integration hook. `qr_watch.sh` is
the interactive counterpart — it polls the endpoint until a code decodes,
prints the payload on stdout, and exits, reporting `409`/`503` distinctly so a
busy tap or a disabled snapshot does not read as an empty frame; `-c` keeps it
scanning and streams every decode instead of stopping at the first. Build with
`make qr-decode`.

## [0.58.0] - 2026-07-26

Maruko gains IPU object-detection parity with Star6E: a raw 800x448 NV12 tap
on SCL port 3 feeds the shared ABI-3 plugin, publishes the unchanged DETECT
sidecar trailer, draws optional debug-OSD boxes, and supports pipeline-thread
enable/disable and model reload without restarting video. Teardown follows the
i6c drain-while-disable rule so an IPU reader cannot pin ISP-to-SCL shutdown.

The I6C model is platform-specific; an I6E `.img` is rejected. On the
SSC378QE bench, `inferInterval=1` held the SCL buffer through every IPU invoke
and reduced video from 59.7 to 38.0 fps while producing only 6.9 inferences/s.
At the new Maruko default `inferInterval=2`, the alternate-frame drain breaks
that backpressure loop: video stays at 59.7 fps and detection reaches 8.5-10.1
Hz. The final 15-second sample measured 9.46 Hz with 51 ms median / 94 ms p95
snapshot age and no new VENC ring-drop lines. Star6E's existing 800x448 bench
is 9-10 Hz, 52/96 ms age, and 90 FRAME/s. Detector throughput and freshness
are therefore at parity; encode rate remains the configured sensor/backend
difference.

Small-flash Maruko deployments can keep the model as an xz archive under
`/root/models`; `S95waybeam` stages the exact configured `/tmp/*.img` before
startup. Contract 0.15.0 records Maruko support for the existing detect fields.

## [0.57.0] - 2026-07-26

`frame-shm://` egress no longer answers a full ring by throwing away an
encoded frame. When the ring backs up, the encoder now lowers its own
bitrate until the consumer keeps up.

**The bug this closes.** `venc_frame_ring_begin_write()` returns -1 on a full
ring and `star6e_output_send_frame_ring()` discards the whole frame. That drop
lands *after* encode, so the H.265 reference chain breaks and the receiver
decodes garbage until the next IDR or the end of the GDR cycle. Post-encode
frame skipping is the same mistake v0.9.2 shipped and reverted; dropping
frames was never backpressure, it was the damage.

Ring geometry is 8 slots x 384 KB — 80 ms of queue at 100 fps. By the time it
is *full* the latency budget is already gone, so the control variable is
occupancy, not the drop counter.

**What shipped** — `src/venc_shm_throttle.c`, a pure AIMD controller evaluated
every 200 ms on the window's **low-water** occupancy:

    low_water >= 2       permille = max(250, permille * 4/5)
    full_drops increased permille = max(250, permille * 3/5), once per window
    low_water <= 1       permille = min(1000, permille + 50)

Low-water, not high-water, and the bench is what settled it. On `.232` at
100 fps a *healthy* consumer still lets the ring spike to 2-3 slots inside a
200 ms window and drains it again — it reads one frame per event-loop
iteration, so short bursts are normal. High-water read those as congestion
and clamped 15-25 % at random, oscillating 740-1000 with nothing wrong.
Low-water asks whether the ring failed to drain *at any point* in the window;
if it touched bottom, the consumer is keeping up. After the change, 30 s of
healthy operation holds at exactly 1000 with zero drops.

The drop charge is capped at once per window for a related reason: a full
ring increments `full_drops` on *every* frame, so an uncapped per-frame x3/5
is `0.6^20` inside one window — an instant slam to the floor on the first
congested window, with no chance to settle at an intermediate rate. That is
what the bench showed before the cap: 781 -> 250 in well under a second.

Retreat to the floor takes ~1.4 s, recovery to unclamped ~3.0 s. The 250 floor
means a wedged consumer cannot drive the encoder to nothing; entering and
leaving the floor is logged exactly once each, because a clamp silently pinned
at its floor has spent all its authority and reads as "working" when it is not.

**It is a clamp, never a veto.** The factor multiplies the bitrate programmed
into the SDK and `video0.bitrate` is never written. That is what keeps an
external rate controller's write-on-change cache coherent — every write still
succeeds and lands in config — and keeps the WebUI slider, `mod_venc` and curl
truthful. Returning an error from the setter was considered and rejected: a
write-on-change controller treats non-2xx as a failure, never commits, and
re-pushes the identical value forever.

Steady-state rate stays owned by the external controller. The split is by
timescale: this loop is ~200 ms, the link's actuators are 1.5-8 s. Keep that
>=5x separation if you retune either side, or the two couple into oscillation.

**The IDR trap.** `apply_bitrate()` forces an IDR so the decoder resyncs
against the new RC state. The clamp re-programs as often as every 200 ms while
the ring is backed up, and an IDR is the largest frame the encoder emits —
IDR-ing through congestion would feed the queue being drained. The throttle
path goes through `apply_bitrate_ex(kbps, want_idr=0)`; small between-IDR rate
changes are absorbed by the rate controller, which the existing rate-limit
gate already relies on.

Pipeline-thread applies take `venc_api_cfg_trylock()` rather than blocking:
a restart-class HTTP set holds that mutex across a full pipeline reinit, and
stalling the encode loop behind it is worse than skipping one advisory update.
A missed window is retried 200 ms later.

**Config** — `outgoing.shmThrottle` (bool, live, **default on**). Everything
else is compile-time, following `include/idr_rate_limit.h`; exposing water
marks as config was tried in v0.9.2 and removed as more noise than useful.
Default-on because a clamp that only ever reduces below what was already
requested is hard to make worse than an uncorrected whole-frame drop, and the
wfb rigs, bench harnesses and `radeon-vrx` / hub consumers have no rate
controller at all.

**Observability** — `throttlePermille` and `effectiveBitrateKbps` in
`/api/v1/transport/status`; a `thrNN%` suffix on the debug-OSD `br` row when
engaged (absent when unclamped, so the common case stays uncluttered); and
`throttle_permille` in the sidecar TRANSPORT_INFO trailer, carved from the old
`_pad[2]` so the trailer stays 16 bytes and every later trailer keeps its
offset. A pre-0.57 producer sends 0 there, which consumers must read as "not
reported", not "clamped to nothing". `_Static_assert`s now pin all three
trailer sizes. frame-shm also emits a TRANSPORT_INFO trailer at all now — the
flag condition had only ever covered `shm://` and the socket transports.

Both backends, one control law — Star6E and Maruko are byte-symmetric here
(same 8 x 384 KB ring), and a per-backend divergence in shared behaviour is a
standing drift trap in this repo.

**Measured on Star6E `.232`**, IMX335 100 fps, `frame-shm://venc_frame`
consumed by `waybeam-link tx`, encoder asked for 60000 kbps on a link that
cannot carry it, 40 s each:

| | frames dropped | frames delivered | loss |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.56.0 | 1949 | 2069 | **48.5 %** |
| 0.57.0 | 110 | 3892 | **2.7 %** |

Half the encoded stream was being discarded post-encode, every drop breaking
the reference chain. Also device-confirmed: `video0.bitrate` reads 25000 (then
60000) in `/api/v1/config` throughout, unchanged by the clamp; recovery from
the floor is 250 -> 500 -> 750 -> 1000 in exactly 3 s with no overshoot, then
pinned; and the floor warning fires exactly once on entry and once on exit.
**Producer health in the ring header.** `health_magic` (`"VHLT"`) at offset
76, `full_drops` u64 at 80, `throttle_permille` u16 at 88 — carved from the
producer-owned pad on cache line 1. `sizeof` stays 192, `version` stays 1,
nothing before them moves, and both external consumers
(`radeon-vrx`, `waybeam-link`) address this header by *byte offset*, so the
change is invisible to them. `_Static_assert`s now pin every header offset,
because a reorder would move these out from under both consumers with
nothing failing to compile.

`full_drops` closes a structural blind spot: the counter is otherwise
process-local to venc, so an ingress node cannot see the drops it is
causing. `health_magic` is what stops a new consumer reading an old
producer's zeroed pad as "no drops" — it is published last, after the
counters and before `init_complete`. Consumers must treat a mismatched
marker as "does not report health", and must never reject a ring because
these bytes are non-zero; that check, applied to the per-frame meta, is what
made `radeon-vrx` drop every delta frame against a #179 producer.
Canonical spec: `protocols/frame-shm.md`.

Not included: the bounded `outgoing.shm_block_us` net. It only engages after
this clamp has already failed, and it blocks the encode thread — the
SigmaStar D-state / MI_SYS wedge path. It waits until the clamp has device
numbers.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-07-25

Star6E AWB actually adapts now. `isp.awbMode=auto` was not adaptive: AWB latched
whatever it estimated in the first second and never moved again, leaving a
standing cast (a visible yellow on IMX335) that no scene change corrected.

**Cause.** Two things in `star6e_pipeline.c` left AWB with nothing driving it.
`MI_ISP_DisableUserspace3A` at ISP bin load kills the SDK 3A_Proc thread, and
`MI_ISP_CUS3A_Enable(0, {0,0,0})` ~1 s after start returns every module to the
ISP-internal algorithms. AE survives that (it is driven separately, which is
why only colour looked wrong), but the internal AWB does not converge here.

**Why not simply keep the SDK's 3A stack.** Because it runs per frame. Measured
on .232: correct colour and genuine convergence at 60 fps for +6pp venc CPU, but
at 120 fps it pins the CPU at 100% and the box is unusable. Maruko solves this
with a `CUS3A_RunOnce` pacer — not portable, i6e `libmi_isp.so` exports no
`RunOnce`/`RunOnceEn`/`SetRunMode` (i6c only).

**What shipped instead** — a userspace AWB loop (`src/star6e_awb.c`) that runs at
a rate we choose rather than per frame:

    MI_ISP_AWB_GetAwbHwAvgStats   128x90 block R/G/B averages, computed by
                                  hardware, free to read
    grey-world + block rejection  a few hundred microseconds
    MI_ISP_CUS3A_SetAwbParam      apply

AWB is handed to userspace (`Cus3AEnable_t.bAWB = 1`) so this loop owns it.
Because nothing is per frame, **cost is independent of frame rate** — that is the
entire point, and it is what the SDK stack could not offer. Rate is
`isp.awbFps` (default 15 Hz, 0 disables). Gains are damped (1/4 per tick) and
gated by a 3% deadband so a settled scene stops rewriting them; degenerate
scenes are handled by rejecting saturated/black blocks, requiring ≥5% of the
frame usable, and clamping the result.

`isp.awbMode=ct_manual` is unchanged for the operator and still hard-locks the
colour temperature: it hands AWB back to the ISP-internal algorithm, which is
what the existing `MI_ISP_AWB_SetCTMwbAttr` path applies through, and stands the
loop down. `awbFps=0`, a failed loop start, or manual mode all leave AWB exactly
where it is today.

`isp.awbFps` applies **live** — retuning the rate, stopping the loop and
restarting it all happen without a restart, because the rate is a plain store
the loop thread reads on its next wake and ownership of the AWB module can be
moved at any time. Crossing 0 in either direction moves that ownership: 0 hands
AWB back to the ISP before standing the thread down, and a non-zero rate starts
the loop and takes ownership only if the mode is `auto`. Range is clamped to
[0, 30] — the loop sleeps `1000/hz` integer milliseconds, so a large enough rate
would round to a zero sleep and spin a core. Backends without the loop (Maruko,
whose AWB is driven by the SDK's own 3A) answer `501` rather than accept the
write and silently do nothing with it.

Related fix in the same area: `isp.awbMode=auto` handed AWB to the userspace
loop unconditionally, including when `awbFps=0` meant no loop was running. That
left the module owned by an algorithm that does not exist — strictly worse than
the non-converging internal one it replaced. Ownership now follows the loop.

The debug OSD `awb` row now reads the applied gains from the loop rather than
`MI_ISP_AWB_QueryInfo` — that reports the ISP-internal algorithm's last state,
which is frozen precisely because it is no longer running. In userspace mode the
row reads `r<R> b<B> usr#<n>`, where `n` counts applied corrections and is the
liveness signal (moving = tracking, steady = converged).

**Device-verified on .232** (SSC338Q / IMX335): from the frozen 2111/2250 the
loop converges to ~1128/3496 — within a few percent of both what the SDK's own
AWB reached (1165/3254) and what grey-world predicts from the hardware stats
(1104/3498). At **100 fps with NPU detection also running: 51% venc CPU**,
0 CMDQ/ISP-WQ errors. A forced `ct_manual` excursion to 2800 K and back is
recovered smoothly.

**Do not "fix" the `int[]`-vs-struct call.** `Cus3AEnable_t` is
`{MI_BOOL bAE, bAWB, bAF}` with `MI_BOOL = unsigned char`, so
`int p110[13] = {1,1,0}` reads as `bAE=1, bAWB=0, bAF=0` — the AWB flag lands in
padding. That is true but the accidental behaviour was benign, because
`CUS3A_Enable` means "hand this module to *custom* code", not "run this algo".
The struct is now passed correctly and `bAWB` is set deliberately.

## [0.55.0] - 2026-07-25

Debug OSD: an actual-bitrate row on both backends, and the Maruko-only
diagnostic rows brought across to Star6E.

**New `br` row (both backends).** Shows the encoder's real output rate against
its configured RC target, e.g. `br: 8123/10000k`. The rate is summed from the
encoder's own per-frame sizes (`star6e_scene_frame_size` /
`maruko_scene_frame_size`) over the OSD's existing 1 Hz window, **not** from
bytes handed to the transport — so it stays truthful when `output_enabled` is 0
and excludes packetization overhead. The gap between actual and target is the RC
undershoot/overshoot, which is also the fastest way to tell an encoder problem
from a link problem: an encoder tracking target while the picture stutters points
at the radio. Previously this number was only reachable via `[verbose]` log
lines (gated on `system.verbose`) or a subscribed sidecar probe.

**Star6E gains four rows Maruko already had.** Both backends share the
`src/debug_osd.c` renderer, but row *content* is written at each backend's own
call site, and Star6E's had fallen behind:

- `exp` — shutter µs, sensor/ISP gain, gain ceiling.
- `ae` — scene luma, AE target, and stable/adjusting/at-limit state.
- `awb` — R/B gains, colour temperature, stable state.
- `stab` / `sfil` — Kalman correction (`a`) and raw detector measurement (`m`)
  in stab pixels, plus pause state. Hidden when no stab thread runs.

New `star6e_controls_ae_osd_status()` reuses the AE/AWB query machinery already
in `star6e_controls.c` (`ae_diag_snapshot_collect`, the `AeExpoInfo_t` /
`IspExposureLimit` / `AwbQueryInfo_t` typedefs, the `MI_ISP_AWB_QueryInfo`
dlopen pattern) — no new SDK bindings. Shutter/gain fall back to
`MI_SNR_GetPlaneInfo` when the ISP AE query does not answer, which is what keeps
the row populated under CUS3A/userspace-3A. `star6e_framing_stab_osd_status()`
mirrors its Maruko counterpart. All of it refreshes at 1 Hz on the existing OSD
tick, never per frame — each AE/AWB refresh dlopens libmi_isp and round-trips
several MI_ISP getters.

**Two rows deliberately not ported.** Maruko's AR centre-crop `crop` row reads
`ctx->scl_crop_*`, an i6c-only feature with no Star6E counterpart (Star6E's
`crop` row remains the zoom-derived one). Star6E's `det` detection-box overlay
stays Star6E-only — it is fed by the i6e IPU.

No renderer changes were needed: `debug_osd_text()` self-clips against the canvas
height and paints its own per-row background, so extra rows need no panel resize
or row-count constant. The added rows are conditional on their data being valid,
so an idle box does not pay for all of them.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-07-25

Startup NPU scrub: every Star6E start runs a bare `MI_IPU_CreateDevice` +
`MI_IPU_DestroyDevice` cycle before pipeline bring-up (`star6e_ipu_scrub`,
measured 0.1–2.2 s depending on how cold the IPU firmware is, no-op when
`/dev/mi_ipu` is absent). This closes the residual ISP-CMDQ
wedge left open by 0.53.0, and fresh bench work on a healthy box narrowed that
wedge considerably:

- **The actual wedge condition** (reproduced 2/2, all other paths clean): the
  detector was started **at pipeline bring-up** (from config at init), later
  stopped **live**, and then a fork+exec respawn fired — the successor, which
  never touches the IPU, wedges at ISP init. A detector started *live* on a
  running pipeline does not poison the same sequence (1/2 sessions' worth of
  contrary lore came from a degraded box).
- **Not actually broken on a healthy box**: external stop/start with *any* gap
  (the "wait ~20 s" rule measured earlier was an artifact of accumulated wedge
  damage — kernel-side MMA chunks and the per-device proc entries drain within
  ~1-2 s of teardown); and a `MUT_RESTART` respawn while detection is *running*
  (the successor re-creates the IPU device from the carried config and
  reconciles the state).
- **Maruko/i6c**: setting `detect.enabled` now returns HTTP 501 (the live-apply
  group requires the backend's `apply_detect_reload` callback, which only
  Star6E registers). Intentional — previously the set was accepted and burned a
  full respawn on a backend that has no detector at all; an explicit refusal is
  more honest than a pointless restart.
- **Why the scrub works**: whatever state a predecessor's IPU teardown leaves
  behind is reset by the next IPU device create — from any process. Running the
  cycle before VIF/VPE/ISP bring-up makes every successor a reconciler
  regardless of its detect config. Verified 2/2 on the previously-wedging
  sequence, plus clean cold starts and live toggles. A scrub *after* the ISP
  has wedged does not recover it, hence startup placement, and unconditional —
  the poison survives process exit, so no flag from the previous instance can
  know whether it is needed.

## [0.53.0] - 2026-07-25

`detect.enabled` is applied live instead of by a `MUT_RESTART` respawn. The
respawn was leaving the successor pipeline permanently frameless on Star6E, and
no respawn-side fix is possible — the state is pinned by an fd the child cannot
close.

- **The wedge** — after `/api/v1/set?detect.enabled=false`, the fresh process
  never emitted a frame: `fps/live` 0, `framesSent` stuck, `waiting for encoder
  data...`. Its ISP CMDQ sits mid-`WAIT` on the `ISP_TRIG` event with a corrupt
  ring read pointer (`r=0x03000026` where a healthy ring reads `0x30000260`), so
  `FrameStartProc` can never claim buffer space — `MDrvCmdqWriteCommandMask cmdq
  buffer isn't available(0)` and then an endless `ISP_IRQ_WQ_FRAME_START add WQ
  error!` storm. VPE's input FIFO never drains (`EnsureInputPortFifoEmpty ... no
  response in 1000ms`, `mod7 dev0 pass0 infer timeout`), and the storm floods the
  console hard enough to make the box unresponsive. `S95waybeam restart` often
  did not clear it. Reproduced 3/3 on .232 (SSC338Q / IMX335).
- **Root cause: the inherited `/dev/mi_sys` fd**, not time and not port state.
  Eliminated on device, in order: a stale-enabled port1 or stale user depth (the
  dying process's `SetChnOutputPortDepth(0,0)` and `DisablePort(0,1)` both
  returned 0, and the successor found port1 already disabled); a 3 s settle
  inside the parent's teardown; post-exit settles of 4.5 s and 15 s in the
  respawn child; `cold_vif` plus 4 s; closing every inherited `/dev/mi_*` except
  `mi_sys` plus 8 s. An external stop/start — every fd closed at exit — is clean
  with a 20 s gap and wedges with 1 s. Closing `mi_sys` in the child is this
  SoC's confirmed deadlock, so **no fork+exec respawn can recover from a
  detect-active parent**. A successor that re-creates an IPU device reconciles
  the state, which is why detect on->on restarts and live model swaps never
  showed it.
- **Fix: `detect.enabled` is `MUT_LIVE`** (`venc_api.c`), routed through the
  existing `LIVE_GROUP_DETECT` / `apply_detect_reload` service, which now
  dispatches start / stop / reload from the committed value. No respawn happens
  on the transition at all, so the wedge cannot be reached — and toggling the
  detector no longer costs a ~25 s stream outage.
- **Start/stop policy factored out** (`star6e_pipeline_detect_start/_stop`) so
  the port1 arbiter claim and the framing-conflict refusal cannot drift between
  the initial bring-up and the live toggle. Both run on the pipeline thread, the
  same thread that reads the detect snapshot.
- **`copy_live_group_fields()` now copies `detect.enabled`** — omitting it
  silently turned the toggle into a same-state reload (the value never reached
  the committed config).
- **Teardown hygiene** — `iy_unload_graph()` releases the port1 user output
  depth it registered before disabling the port, and the pre-init teardown
  disables VPE port1 as well as port0. Neither caused the wedge; both are state
  this code registers and should release.

Known limitation: any *other* `MUT_RESTART` change made while detection is
running (e.g. `video0.size`) still respawns and still hits the wedge above.
Disable detection first, or restart the process externally. A general fix needs
the respawn to exec from a process forked before any `/dev/mi_*` is opened.

## [0.52.0] - 2026-07-25

Hot-swap the offline NPU detector `.img` without respawning the pipeline, so
the main video0 RTP stream is uninterrupted (no gap, no keyframe reset, no
reconnect) when only the model changes. Detection runs off the VPE0 port1 tap,
independent of the video0 encode path, so a detector-only reload is clean.

- **Detector-only reload entrypoint** (`star6e_ipu_yolo.c`) — the init is
  factored into `iy_load_graph()` / `iy_unload_graph()` halves (plugin dlopen,
  VPE port1 tap create, backend init) plus an `iy_stop_reader()` reader-join
  helper. New `star6e_ipu_yolo_reload(state, vcfg)` tears down and re-creates
  only the detector plugin + tap channel while the encoder keeps running.
- **Geometry guard** — the live path is taken only when `net_width`/`net_height`
  are unchanged; a dims change needs the VPE port recreated, so it falls back to
  the full `MUT_RESTART` respawn. The multiple-of-32 / min-64 checks are shared
  by start and reload via `iy_resolve_net_dims()`.
- **Model geometry is now verified against the tap** — plugin ABI bumped to `2`,
  adding a required `model_dims()` that reports the loaded `.img`'s REAL input
  geometry, plus `net_width`/`net_height` in `DetectBackendConfig`. The host
  compares the two and refuses a mismatch (`iy_check_model_dims()`), because
  config is not evidence of what a model expects. Since `model_path` is live but
  the dims are restart-scope, pointing `model_path` at a different-geometry
  model was previously accepted silently and left an "active" detector that
  never detected — the backend rejects every frame and `process()` errors are
  not logged. A refusal names both geometries and the exact `netWidth`/
  `netHeight` to set, leaves detection off, releases the port1 claim, and does
  not disturb the stream. ABI is an exact match (no compatibility window during
  beta), so an ABI-1 plugin is rejected at load with a clear diagnostic.
- **Swap cost, measured** — a model change does not respawn the pipeline, drop
  frames at the transport, force a keyframe, or reconnect, but it is not free:
  the NPU graph load runs on the pipeline thread (which is what makes it atomic
  against the per-frame snapshot), so frame output stalls for its duration. On
  Star6E .232 at 100 fps the stall was **~100-450 ms** on some runs and
  **~2.2-2.5 s** on others, with no in-between. The fast runs correlate with a
  freshly booted or freshly restarted process and the slow ones with a pipeline
  respawn having happened, but that did not hold in every trial (one
  init-script restart stayed slow, another came back fast), so the trigger is
  **not isolated** — it is not memory pressure, not file I/O (a pre-warmed
  `.img` reads in 0.01 s with the stall unchanged), and not accumulation across
  reloads (flat within a process). Treat **~2.5 s** as the planning number.
  Only a `model_path` change pays this; see the in-place path below.
- **Only a model change reloads the graph** — `model_id` is a label stamped into
  the snapshot and `conf_thresh` / `nms_iou` are decode-time knobs, yet all
  three shared `LIVE_GROUP_DETECT` and so rebuilt the NPU graph, paying the full
  stall to change a number. `star6e_ipu_yolo_reload()` now compares the
  requested `model_path` against what is loaded and, when it is unchanged,
  applies the label and thresholds in place — the graph and the tap are never
  torn down. Thresholds go through the new optional ABI-3 `set_thresholds()`
  with the reader briefly parked (it parks between frames) so the decode is not
  reading them as they are written; a backend without it falls back to the full
  reload. Measured on .232 in the slow regime: threshold-only **50 ms** and
  `model_id`-only **0 ms**, against ~2300 ms before.
- **Mutability wiring** (`venc_api.c`) — `detect.model_path` is now `MUT_LIVE`,
  and `detect.model_id` / `conf_thresh` / `nms_iou` are newly settable
  (`MUT_LIVE`); a new `LIVE_GROUP_DETECT` applies them via `apply_detect_reload`
  instead of setting `g_reinit`. `detect.net_width` / `net_height` are settable
  as `MUT_RESTART`. Added range validators for the four new fields.
- **Atomicity + concurrency** — the swap runs on the pipeline (encode) thread
  via a request posted by the HTTP apply hook and serviced between frames
  (`star6e_controls_service_detect_reload`), so it is atomic w.r.t. the
  per-frame `DETECT` snapshot query and the failure path (which frees the
  detector context) can never race a `snapshot()` read. The request carries a
  full `VencConfig` snapshot taken under `g_cfg_mutex`, and the pipeline thread
  reloads from a private copy of it — so the (potentially slow) NPU graph load
  never reads the live config lock-free, even if the HTTP wait times out or a
  second `/set` arrives. A `paused` flag quiesces the consumer across the swap;
  the `DETECT` sidecar trailer is simply absent for the duration of the swap
  (consumers already tolerate "no DETECT"). The wire `model_id` is latched into
  the detector snapshot alongside the boxes, so it flips in lockstep with the
  first new-model `DETECT` (never tagging the last old-model boxes with the new
  id), and the `describe()` class-count cross-check re-runs after each reload.
- Both `.img` files can be pre-staged (e.g. on SD); switching needs no
  `/api/v1/restart`. Changing `netWidth`/`netHeight` still takes the full
  respawn path (unchanged). No change to the RTP-sidecar wire ABI.
- Contract `0.14.0`; `test_venc_api` gains four detect live/restart/validation
  cases (2089/0); both backends build clean.

### VPE port-ownership arbiter + `vpe_taps` observability

Cross-feature alignment for the VPE0 scaler outputs, so the detector and the
stab framing tap cannot both program the single second scaler, and an operator
can see the allocation.

- **Arbiter** (`star6e_vpe_ports.{c,h}`) — a single owner for VPE0 **port1**
  (the lone second scaler output): stab XOR detect. `star6e_vpe_port1_claim()`
  refuses a second claim while it is held; the pipeline claims it for the stab
  motion tap and for the detector, so their mutual exclusion is now enforced by
  the arbiter instead of an ad-hoc `if (g_framing)`. `FramingModule` gains a
  `uses_vpe_port1` flag (stab=true; stab-fill=false — it drains port0 and
  composes in SW, so it takes no port1 tap but stays detect-exclusive by an
  explicit resource policy).
- **Observability** — the arbiter publishes a `runtime.vpe_taps` block to
  `/api/v1/config` via `venc_api_set_vpe_taps()`: `port0` lists the 1:N
  consumers of the shared main output (`main` always; `jpeg`/`record` when
  those channels are up — the JPEG snapshot is a port0 consumer, not a second
  tap), and `port1` names its sole owner or `null`. Star6E only; absent on
  Maruko.
- `test_star6e_vpe_ports` covers claim/refuse/release/idempotence and the
  published JSON (2103/0).

## [0.51.1] - 2026-07-24

Detector hardening follow-ups from the v0.51.0 upstream review — four
defensive fixes, no behavioural change on the normal path.

- **Idempotent `libmi_sys` load** (`star6e_ipu_yolo.c`) — the detector opened
  `libmi_sys.so` on every start and never closed it, so each SIGHUP reinit with
  `detect.enabled` bumped the dlopen refcount unboundedly. The handle is now
  cached in a file-static and opened once for the run.
- **Float→pixel clamp before the cast** (`star6e_runtime.c`) — the debug-OSD box
  path clamped only the low side before the `float`→`uint32_t` conversion, so a
  huge/`inf`/`NaN` edge from an out-of-contract plugin hit implementation-defined
  UB before the high clamp ran. New `osd_box_px()` helper does the full range
  clamp (negatives, `inf`, `NaN` → in-range) in float, then casts.
- **NaN-safe wire quantization** (`detect_wire.c`) — `norm_coord()` / `score_u8()`
  used `<=0` / `>=1` guards that a `NaN` slips through (all comparisons false),
  reaching an implementation-defined cast. Reordered to `!(x > 0)` so `NaN` maps
  to 0. Adds four `test_detect_wire` cases (negative / huge / `inf` / `NaN`
  coords and scores) asserting the wire output stays in range.
- **ipu_probe overflow guard** (`tools/ipu_probe.c`, dev-only) — the tensor
  element count is now checked against `size_t` multiply overflow and the
  source `aligned_buf_size` before `malloc`/dequant, so a malformed `.img` fed
  to the bring-up tool can no longer short-allocate or over-read.
- `make test-werror` / `test-asan` **2078/0**; cross-build clean both backends;
  `ipu-probe` clean under `-Wall -Wextra`.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-07-24

Detector tuning surface: expose the confidence/NMS thresholds, the tap
geometry, and the wire `model_id` as config (#191). These rode into the fork
under the 0.50.0 tag without their own bump; versioned here so the config is
documented and the version uniquely identifies the build.

- **`detect.confThresh` / `detect.nmsIou`** now reach the plugin. The plugin
  ABI has carried these since the boundary landed, but the host passed zeros so
  every backend ran on its built-in `0.40` / `0.45`. `0.40` is too high for the
  small-object workload — INT8 quantization costs ~30% of the FP32 score on
  small objects — and the ground tracker confirms weak detections over time, so
  running the detector at ~`0.20` and letting the tracker's 2-hit confirmation
  reject noise is the intended architecture. `<=0` = plugin default.
- **`detect.netWidth` / `detect.netHeight`** replace the hardcoded `640x352`
  VPE port1 tap. That geometry was inherited from the collaborator's VisDrone
  model, not chosen for this sensor, and is the single largest constraint on
  small-object recall. Validated at start: both dims must be multiples of 32
  (the head strides 8/16/32) and must match the compiled `.img` (the backend
  already rejects a mismatched frame). `0` -> `640` / `352`.
- **`detect.modelId`** puts a configurable class-table selector on the DETECT
  sidecar trailer (see `documentation/RTP_SIDECAR_PROTOCOL.md`). It was
  hardcoded to VisDrone, so a one-class SAR-person model announced itself as
  VisDrone-10 and every box came out labelled "pedestrian". `model_id` cannot
  be derived — the plugin loads whatever `.img` `detect.modelPath` names — so it
  is operator config, registered alongside `netWidth`/`netHeight`. The host now
  calls the plugin's `describe()` hook at start and warns when the reported
  class count contradicts the configured id; unknown ids skip the check (a
  private `model_id` is legitimate).
- All new members appended at the END of `VencConfigDetect` — the config ABI is
  append-only (SigmaStar ISP bin loading breaks if `VencConfig`'s layout
  shifts). Host tests **2074/0**; cross-build clean both backends.
- **Docs**: adds `documentation/RTP_SIDECAR_PROTOCOL.md` — a self-contained
  in-tree spec for the RTP sidecar wire format (FRAME base, trailer ordering,
  ENC_INFO/TRANSPORT_INFO/ATTITUDE/DETECT, and the `model_id` registry),
  tracking the canonical `include/rtp_sidecar.h`.

## [0.50.0] - 2026-07-23

Volatile config writes: `GET /api/v1/live/set`.

- **New endpoint `/api/v1/live/set`** — `/set`'s field surface applied to the
  running config only, no write to `/etc/waybeam.json`.  Built for
  high-cadence automated writers (waybeam-link adaptive bitrate / frame-cap /
  fps actuation, waybeam-link spec Pass 73): persist-on-set at controller
  cadence wears flash and reboots into the last adaptive transient.
- Live (MUT_LIVE) fields only; restart-required fields answer `400`
  ("restart-class field requires persistence; use /api/v1/set") because a
  pipeline reinit reloads from disk and would silently discard the value.
  Response shapes are byte-identical to `/set`; single- and multi-set both
  supported.
- A later persisting `/set` / `/defaults` snapshots the whole running config,
  volatile changes included (one config struct, by design).
- Builds without the endpoint 404 — clients probe once and fall back to the
  persisting `/set` (waybeam-link does exactly this).
- Contract version 0.12.1 -> 0.13.0 (non-breaking endpoint addition).

## [0.49.0] - 2026-07-19

WebUI exposure for the per-frame size caps.

- **`video0.maxIBytes` / `video0.maxPBytes` in the dashboard** — the 0.45.0
  frame-size caps were API-only; they now carry data-driven UI metadata
  (`FIELD_UI`) and render as a "Frame size caps" group from
  `/api/v1/capabilities`. No dashboard.html change — the group comes entirely
  from the capabilities feed, tooltips included (cap semantics, the
  framebits-first/bitrate-first RC-priority flip, IDR-on-apply).

## [0.48.0] - 2026-07-19

Star6E NPU object detection (#183): pluggable object detection on the idle
IPU, results streamed as sidecar metadata and drawn on the debug OSD.

- **Detector plugin boundary** (`include/detect_plugin.h`): the host owns the
  VPE port1 tap (model-input-size NV12, drop-not-block), the reader thread,
  config, and the carriers; a dlopen'd plugin `.so` (`detect.plugin`) owns the
  IPU device and the decode and returns `DetectBox[]`.  New model = config
  change, no venc rebuild; all model-specific code (models, decode, class
  tables, usage docs) lives with the plugin, out of this repo.
- **RTP sidecar DETECT trailer** (flag 0x10, appended last): per-frame
  detection metadata — 16 B header (model_id, schema_ver, count, detect_seq,
  payload_len, age_ms) + TLV body with normalized-u16 BOX records.  Attached
  every frame while a subscriber is present, for RF-loss resilience.  The
  sidecar send path was rebuilt around a 512 B datagram buffer with
  flag-ordered variable trailers (spec: coordination `protocols/rtp-sidecar.md`).
- **Debug-OSD box rendering** (`detect.osd`, needs `debug.showOsd`): the
  encode-thread OSD pass scales the published snapshot onto the canvas and
  draws palette-colored rects per class plus a `det N` row; snapshots older
  than 700 ms are not drawn.
- Reader publishes a mutex double-buffered snapshot (<= 64 boxes) consumed by
  both the sidecar and the OSD; lock held only for the copy, never across an
  IPU invoke.  Detection is best-effort — any bring-up failure logs and the
  stream continues without it.  `detect` config block is trailing/append-only;
  detect and `framing=stab` are mutually exclusive (both claim VPE port1).
- WebUI: new **Detection** dashboard section exposing the `detect.*` config
  fields (enabled, plugin, modelPath, firmwarePath, inferInterval, osd).
- New host tests: `tests/test_detect_wire.c` (39 cases) for the trailer
  builder; sidecar send-path call sites updated.


## [0.47.0] - 2026-07-18

Retire the Star6E `aeEngine=custom` userspace AE and remove the `custom` value
entirely (mirrors Maruko's 0.22.0 move).

- **`aeEngine=custom` is removed.**  The `cus3a` thread never did AE convergence —
  the ISP firmware/bin AE always drives it, in both engine modes.  Since 0.46.0
  made the thread enforce gain/shutter limits under `sdk` too, the only thing
  `custom` still did was run the fps-derived shutter cap and the cold-boot fps
  kick from the thread instead of the pipeline.  Star6E now always runs the single
  limits-only enforcer beside the firmware AE.  `isp.aeEngine` accepts only `sdk`;
  any other value (including a stale `custom` in an old config) warns and falls
  back to `sdk`, so existing configs still load.
- Behaviour for the default (`sdk`) path is unchanged: convergence, cold-boot fps
  recovery (pipeline `cap_exposure_for_fps` + `MI_SNR_SetFps` kicks, now
  unconditional), and gain/shutter min/max enforcement all behave exactly as in
  0.46.0.  The retirement does **not** adopt custom's continuous fps-derived
  shutter cap — the pipeline already caps at init and on bin reload.
- Removed the now-dead custom-only internals from `star6e_cus3a` (the
  `limits_only`/`sensor_fps` config fields, the `MI_SNR_SetFps` symbol + the
  frame-15 cold-boot kick, and `compute_max_shutter`'s fps fallback) and made the
  pipeline's three cold-boot `SetFps` kicks unconditional.  `start_custom_ae` →
  `start_ae_enforcer`, `star6e_pipeline_legacy_fps_rekick` →
  `star6e_pipeline_cold_boot_fps_rekick`.
- Dropped the vestigial `VencConfigIsp::legacy_ae` / `ae_mode` derived fields, the
  `MarukoConfig::ae_mode` mirror, and both backends' retirement-NOTE branches —
  `custom` no longer exists to record.
- `make verify` clean both backends; `test-werror` + `test-asan` **1979/0**.
  Device-verified on `.201` (IMX335): `sdk` enforcer clamps the live firmware AE
  (gainMax 5000→gain 5000, revert→30000); cold-boot fps holds 60.  `.201`
  restored to its 0.45.0 baseline.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-07-18

Manual minimum exposure / gain floors for the supervisory AE.

- **New `isp.gainMin` / `isp.shutterMinUs` live controls** — set an explicit
  minimum sensor gain and minimum exposure (µs) floor for the 3A, completing
  the manual min/max envelope alongside the existing `isp.gainMax` /
  `isp.shutterMaxUs` ceilings.  Both default `0` = "use the ISP bin's
  calibrated floor" (no override).
- The supervisory cus3a thread writes the floors into `minSensorGain` /
  `minShutterUs` of the ISP exposure limit on startup and re-enforces them
  each tick.  Each floor is clamped so it can never exceed its ceiling, and
  `isp.shutterRule180` (which pins `min==max`) takes precedence over a manual
  `shutterMin`.  Setting a floor back to `0` restores the ISP bin's calibrated
  floor (the thread captures `minSensorGain`/`minShutterUs` from the bin at
  startup and falls back to it, mirroring the ceiling's `bin_max_*` fallback).
  `MUT_LIVE`, both Star6E and Maruko backends.  Device-verified on `.201`
  (IMX335) and `.233` (IMX415): floors apply, clamp to ceiling, pin overrides
  shutter floor, and `0` restores the bin default.
- **Star6E: the supervisory thread now runs as a limits-only enforcer under the
  SDK firmware AE too** (`aeEngine=sdk`), so `gainMin/Max` + `shutterMin/Max`
  work without switching to the custom AE (Maruko already enforced in both
  modes).  The thread starts whenever `aeFps>0`; in `sdk`/`legacy_ae` it sets
  `limits_only` — it enforces only explicit user gain/shutter min/max (with the
  bin baseline restored on `0`) and skips the fps-derived shutter cap and the
  cold-boot fps kick, which the pipeline already owns in legacy mode.
  Device-verified on `.201` in `sdk`: all four knobs apply and fully revert, and
  a binding `gainMax` genuinely clamps the live firmware AE (long gain 20129 →
  5000 → 3000, luma tracks; recovers on revert) — the AE stays converged.
- camelCase aliases `isp.gainMin` / `isp.shutterMinUs`; added to the config
  schema, pretty-printer, JSON export, default configs, and HTTP API contract.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-07-18

Live per-frame I/P frame-size caps (MaxISize/MaxPSize) with RC priority.

- **New `video0.maxIBytes` / `video0.maxPBytes` live controls** — cap the
  per-frame encoded I-frame and P-frame size via the MI_VENC RC params
  `u32MaxISize` / `u32MaxPSize`. `MUT_LIVE`, applied atomically as a group;
  0 = unlimited (default).
- **RC priority switch** — when either cap is > 0, RC priority is set to
  `FRAMEBITS_FIRST` so the encoder treats the size cap as a hard ceiling;
  when both return to 0, `BITRATE_FIRST` is restored. An IDR is requested
  after each apply.
- **Dual-backend parity** — Star6E (2-arg `MI_VENC_SetRcPriority`) and
  Maruko (3-arg with VeDev), both loaded as optional dlsym symbols
  (NULL-safe). Mode-aware `GetRcParam` → set the correct RC union member
  (H265/H264 × CBR/VBR/AVBR) → `SetRcParam` → `SetRcPriority`.
- **`SetRcPriority` takes a POINTER to the enum** — `MI_VENC_SetRcPriority`'s
  last arg is `MI_VENC_RcPriority_e *peRcPriority`, not the value (verified
  against the i6e/i6c SDK headers). The initial implementation passed the
  enum value, so the SDK dereferenced `0x2` as a pointer and faulted the
  encoder pipeline (SCL teardown + "Sensor abnormal"). Both backends now
  pass the address of a temporary. Device-verified: Star6E .201 (P-cap 5619→
  1868 kbps at maxPBytes=2000, no crash) and Maruko .233 (priority=framebits,
  no crash).
- Config JSON: `maxIBytes` / `maxPBytes` camelCase load/save/render.
- Adds `specs/2026-07-17-capped-vbr-rc-mode/` (requirements + plan) for a
  follow-on capped-VBR profile.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-07-18

Live FPS change improvements and exposure-based FPS override.

- **Reduced live FPS change stream stall** — `apply_fps()` (Star6E) and
  `maruko_apply_fps()` now skip the VPE→VENC unbind/rebind when the
  requested FPS matches the currently delivered FPS (no-op early-out),
  and request an IDR frame immediately after a successful rebind so the
  decoder recovers without waiting for the next GOP boundary.
- **New `isp.shutterMaxUs` live control** — exposes the CUS3A supervisory
  thread's `shutter_max_us` as a `MUT_LIVE` API field.  Setting this
  above the frame period (e.g. 33333 µs at 60 fps bound) forces the
  sensor to skip frames, reducing effective output FPS proportionally
  without the ~0.5 s bind-rebind stall.  Bitrate scales with effective
  FPS.  0 = automatic (1/sensor_fps).  Both Star6E and Maruko backends
  supported.  Dashboard ISP section updated with the new control.
- Config JSON: `isp.shutterMaxUs` parsed and serialized (persists across
  restarts).  Pipeline startup applies a non-zero persisted value to the
  CUS3A config (subordinate to `shutterRule180` when both are set).

## [0.43.0] - 2026-07-15

Frame-SHM tagging for GDR and SVC-T enhance-layer frames.

- **New `VencFrameMeta` flag bits** — `VENC_FRAME_FLAG_GDR` (0x02) and
  `VENC_FRAME_FLAG_ENHANCE` (0x04) in `include/venc_frame_ring.h`. No
  struct size change; uses bits 1–2 of the existing `flags` byte. Old
  consumers ignore unknown bits — no ring version bump needed.
- **GDR cycle position** — the former `reserved` field is replaced by
  `gdr_pos` (0-based position in the refresh cycle) and `gdr_len` (cycle
  length in frames). The transport layer can use these to apply stronger
  FEC or ARQ near the end of the cycle where the refresh completes.
  Cycle length is derived at pipeline init from `ceil(total_ctu_rows /
  lines_per_frame)`. Counter resets on each IDR.
- **GDR tagging** — when intra refresh is active (resilience preset is not
  "off"), every non-IDR frame is tagged with `VENC_FRAME_FLAG_GDR` to
  indicate a rolling intra stripe is present. Both Star6E and Maruko
  backends track `gdr_active` on the output struct.
- **SVC-T enhance tagging** — when temporal scalability is configured
  (`ref_base > 0`), frames with `refType == ENHANCE_P_NOTFORREF` (the
  droppable top enhance layer) are tagged with `VENC_FRAME_FLAG_ENHANCE`.
  Both backends track `svct_active` on the output struct.
- `frame_shm_consumer_test` reports GDR and ENHANCE frame counts plus
  cycle length in both per-second interval output and the final summary.

Device-verification fixes (Star6E IMX335 .201):
- **Fixed: Star6E GDR/SVC-T fields zeroed by output reset.** The pipeline
  set `gdr_active`/`svct_active`/`gdr_cycle_len` before
  `bind_and_finalize_pipeline()`, which calls `star6e_output_init()` →
  `star6e_output_reset()` (a full `memset`), wiping them — so Star6E emitted
  zero GDR/ENHANCE tags. The assignment now runs after finalize.
- **Fixed: wrong `ENHANCE_P_NOTFORREF` refType constant (both backends).**
  It was `4` (the HiSilicon enum value); the SigmaStar i6e/i6c enum inserts
  `BASE_P_REFTOIDR` at index 1, making `ENHANCE_P_NOTFORREF` = `5` (value 4
  is `ENHANCE_P_REFBYENHANCE`, a referenced, non-droppable frame).
  Consolidated into one shared define per backend
  (`STAR6E_REFTYPE_ENHANCE_P_NOTFORREF` in `star6e.h`,
  `MARUKO_REFTYPE_ENHANCE_P_NOTFORREF` in `maruko_video.h`), which also
  corrects the pre-existing TRAIL_R→TRAIL_N error-resilience rewrite in
  `star6e_runtime.c` / `maruko_pipeline.c` that shared the same wrong value.
  Verified on i6e: 1:1 SVC-T → 50% frames tagged ENHANCE and rewritten to
  TRAIL_N; reference frames stay TRAIL_R.

## [0.42.1] - 2026-07-11

- **Frame-SHM wait wakeup hardening.** `venc_frame_ring_read_wait()` now re-checks
  the ring after publishing `consumer_waiting` and before entering the futex wait,
  closing a lost-wake race where a consumer could sleep even though a frame had
  already been committed. The standalone frame-SHM consumer now sizes its read
  buffer from the attached ring header instead of assuming 512 KiB slots.
- **Frame-SHM ring geometry tuned for realtime.** The `frame-shm://` ring now
  allocates 8 slots × 384 KiB (~3 MiB) instead of 16 × 512 KiB (~8 MiB) on both
  Star6E and Maruko backends. Observed ≤1080p IDRs are ≤28 KiB, so 384 KiB
  retains large headroom while a drop-not-block realtime ring needs far fewer
  than 16 in-flight slots. Consumers read the geometry from the ring header, so
  no consumer change is required.
## [0.42.0] - 2026-07-11

Full-frame SHM emissions — a new `frame-shm://` URI scheme that transfers
whole encoded video frames over POSIX shared memory, bypassing RTP
packetization entirely.

- **`venc_frame_ring` — SPSC lock-free ring buffer for whole frames.**
  New `include/venc_frame_ring.h` + `src/venc_frame_ring.c`. Same POSIX SHM /
  futex architecture as `venc_ring` but tuned for video frames: `uint32_t`
  slot lengths (frames can exceed 64 KB), 8-byte `VencFrameMeta` header
  (pts, codec, flags), and a staged write API (`begin_write`/`append`/
  `commit_write`/`abort_write`) that gathers scattered NAL data from the
  encoder stream directly into the ring slot — no staging buffer needed.
  Magic `0x5646524D` ("VFRM"), version 1.
- **`frame-shm://` output URI** — new `VENC_OUTPUT_URI_FRAME_SHM` transport
  on both Star6E and Maruko backends. Creates a 16-slot × 512 KB frame ring
  (~8 MB SHM region). The frame sender iterates the encoder stream packs,
  detects IDR frames from `h265Nalu` types 19/20, populates `VencFrameMeta`,
  and writes raw Annex B data (start codes preserved) so the consumer
  (waybeam-link) can apply its own framing/FEC at frame boundaries.
- Frame-SHM bypasses RTP entirely — no `MarukoRtpState`, no
  `star6e_hevc_rtp`, no sendmmsg batching. The output pressure observer
  reports frame-ring fill alongside the existing RTP-packet ring.
- `apply_server` rejects frame-SHM outputs (no live retarget for SHM).
- Transport type string reports `"frame-shm"` in both backends' controls.
- Unit tests: `tests/test_venc_frame_ring.c` — lifecycle, staged write,
  abort, bulk write, fill/drain, wraparound, concurrent producer/consumer,
  stride alignment, corrupt header/slot, overflow, init_complete, stats,
  fill observation.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-07-11

- **180° shutter rule toggle (`isp.shutterRule180`).** New boolean config
  field (default `false`, restart-required) that pins AE exposure to
  exactly 1/(2×fps) — `minShutterUs == maxShutterUs` in the ISP exposure
  limit, so the AE shutter dimension is locked while gain still
  auto-adjusts for brightness.  At 60 fps the shutter is fixed at
  8 333 µs (1/120 s).  Both Star6E and Maruko backends; the supervisory
  cus3a threads continuously enforce the pin so ISP bin reloads or
  cold-boot AE init cannot override it.  Contract `0.12.1`.

## [0.40.1] - 2026-07-11

Pre-upstream hardening (adversarial review of the #167–175 workstreams).

- **Attitude estimator: reject corrupt IMU samples.** A single NaN/Inf
  accel/gyro value used to poison the complementary filter permanently
  (the accel gate stays false so it never recovers) while
  `attitude_frame_update` still stamped `ATTITUDE.status = valid` — the
  HUD AHI would show a stuck, "valid", perfectly-level horizon. `wrap_pi`
  also spun forever on an Inf argument, hanging the encode thread.
  `attitude_est_update` now drops non-finite samples, `wrap_pi` guards
  non-finite, and the sidecar trailer is gated on a new
  `attitude_est_healthy()` so a non-finite state emits no trailer.
- **Level calibration works at any IMU ODR.** `calibrate_level` required
  256 samples but waited only ≤3 s, so at ODR ≤ ~85 Hz it always timed
  out. It now completes early at the sample target and otherwise accepts
  the ≤2 s window's samples once ≥ 32 are in (and the shorter window
  bounds how long the calibration holds the HTTP dispatch lock).
- **Maruko plain-stab: skip un-mapped tap frames.** The detector ran
  `IveShift` even when the tap copy was skipped (unmapped/short frame),
  correlating a stale or all-black buffer into a bogus shift and a
  one-frame crop jump; it now retries without advancing (parity with the
  stab-fill thread).
- **Fix `make test-werror`/`test-asan`/`test-tsan`.** `test_attitude_est`
  called `fabsf()` on `int16_t` returns → `-Werror=absolute-value`; the
  strict test targets did not build. Added NaN/Inf-hardening regression
  coverage.
- **Remove committed host binary.** `rtp_timing_probe` (an x86-64 build
  artifact) was tracked at the repo root; removed and gitignored.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-07-10

One-click attitude calibration + live attitude API (contract 0.12.0).

- **`GET /api/v1/attitude`** — live fused roll/pitch/yaw snapshot
  (camera frame, post-remap/trims). The estimator now runs whenever
  `attitude.enabled` + `imu.enabled` — no sidecar subscriber needed —
  so the WebUI readout works standalone.
- **`GET /api/v1/attitude/calibrate_level`** — hold the camera level:
  averages ~1.3 s of accel in the frame loop, solves the boresight
  trims exactly (`attitude_axis_map_solve_trims`, unit-tested), and
  persists `attitude.trimRollDeg`/`trimPitchDeg` via the standard
  restart-set path. 409 on no-IMU/moving, 501 on Maruko.
- **WebUI Attitude section**: live roll/pitch/yaw readout (1 Hz poll)
  and a "Capture level trims" button that calibrates, updates the
  fields, and restarts the pipeline.

## [0.39.1] - 2026-07-10

- **Sensor→camera axis remap** (`attitude.axisFwd` / `attitude.axisDown`,
  MUT_RESTART, defaults `+x`/`+z` = identity). A signed permutation
  applied to gyro+accel BEFORE the estimator, correcting boards mounted
  in any of the 24 axis-aligned orientations (the output-side
  `mountDeg`/invert trims only rotate about the camera axis and cannot
  fix a vertical board). Set from a two-pose bench calibration: axisDown
  = the sensor axis reading "down" with the camera level, axisFwd = the
  one reading "down" with the camera nose pointed at the floor. Invalid
  or parallel axes log once and fall back to identity.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-07-10

RTP sidecar: multi-subscriber sender + ATTITUDE trailer (cross-repo spec
`protocols/rtp-sidecar.md`, multi-telemetry HUD group 6).

- **Multi-subscriber sidecar.** The sender now keeps 4 subscriber slots
  keyed by addr:port with per-slot 5 s TTLs; MSG_FRAME fans out to every
  live slot and SYNC_RESP goes only to the requester. Removes the
  single-slot hijack where any MSG_SUBSCRIBE stole the feed from the
  wfb link_controller or ground pipeline-stats consumer.
- **ATTITUDE trailer (flag 0x08, 12 B).** Optional roll/pitch/yaw
  (int16 0.1°) + status + imu_age_ms appended last in flag order.
  Fed by a new complementary-filter estimator (`src/attitude_est.c`,
  unit-tested) running on the BMI270 ring in the Star6E frame loop;
  computed only when `attitude.enabled` AND a subscriber is live.
  Maruko builds carry the config but never emit the trailer (its IMU
  push path is not wired yet).
- **New `attitude` config section** (trailing struct, ABI append-only):
  `enabled`, `mountDeg` (0/90/180/270), `invertRoll`, `invertPitch` —
  all MUT_RESTART, full 7-touch (defaults/parse/pretty/JSON/fields/
  aliases/docs).
- `tools/rtp_timing_probe` decodes and prints the ATTITUDE trailer.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-07-09

Star6E sensor-driver mode quality: **fixed-framerate exposure policy + exact
nominal fps landing** for the in-tree IMX335/IMX415 drivers. Device-verified
on SSC338Q at 192.168.2.201 (IMX335).

- **IMX335: exposure clamp instead of VMAX extension.** The stock
  `SetAEUSecs`/`SetFPS` paths stretched VMAX whenever AE requested more than
  the frame budget — with AE pinned at the 1/144s shutter ceiling (any
  indoor scene) mode 5 ran at VMAX 1887 instead of 1880, delivering a
  brightness-dependent 142–143.5fps instead of 144. Both sites now clamp
  exposure to `vts - 9` (SHR floor); VMAX is pinned by construction.
  Verified: encoder `Fps_1s` 144.00 sustained, VMAX register at seed.
- **IMX335: empirical vts trims** — the real pixel clock runs ~0.2–0.5%
  below the K constant; modes 2/3/4/5 seeds trimmed (3016→3001, 2707→2701,
  2256→2250, 1880→1875) so delivered fps lands at/just above the label.
- **IMX335: orientation (flip) rewrites fixed for the new lineup** — the
  inherited M0F1/M1F1 block used stock indices: our idx 3 got the stock
  1080p AREA3 value and idx 4/5 got no flip writes at all. Extended using
  the verified `AREA3_ST_flipped = 4288 − normal` relation (idx3 3392,
  idx4 3248, idx5 3068 + cropped-mode OB values). Not yet camera-verified
  (bench runs flip=off).
- **IMX335: mode 2 label corrected** to 2560×1440@90 (row said 2400×1350,
  hardware reads out 2560×1440, Y_OUT=1460).
- **IMX415: same fixed-framerate exposure clamp** in `SetAEUSecs`.
- **IMX415: idx 1 retimed 4K@40 → 4K@~33.3** (VMAX 2250→2700 at HMAX=825):
  the 40fps probe sat within ~5% of both the ISP throughput wall and the
  analog HMAX floor; 33.3 keeps margin and still beats stock 4K@30 by ~11%.
  Retime not yet device-verified (no IMX415 on the bench).
- **Exact-CBR compensation for >120fps modes** (closes the deferred
  follow-up in the 2026-07-06 spec): the RC budgets at the 120 fpsNum cap
  while the bind delivers the true rate, so the wire ran ~1.19× the set
  bitrate at 144. The encoder budget is now scaled ×rc_fps/delivered at
  the three sites (pipeline create `venc_max_rate`, live `apply_bitrate`,
  re-applied on `apply_fps` when the factor changes). Device-verified:
  19.6 Mbps wire against a 20 Mbps config at Fps_1s 143.99 (was 23.8).

## [0.37.0] - 2026-07-09

Stabilization: **Maruko `video0.framing = stab-fill`** — full-FOV
stabilization (the whole frame floats on a moving black border, no crop-in) on
the Infinity6C, completing stab parity with Star6E. Device-verified on
SSC378QE at IMX415 1080×720@50 (visual + 5-cycle teardown soak, 0 MMU resets).

- **The Phase 5a "i6c VENC cannot be manually pushed" device result is
  OVERTURNED** — it was an ABI artifact. The i6c `MI_SYS_BufConf_t` differs
  from Star6E's in three load-bearing ways: `E_MI_SYS_BUFDATA_FRAME` is **1**
  (0 is `RAW`!), the struct carries `bDirectBuf`+`bCrcCheck` before the config
  union (union at offset 24, not 16), and `BufFrameConfig` has no embedded
  extra-conf. With the corrected layout, `MI_SYS_ChnInputPortGetBuf/PutBuf`
  straight into a `NORMAL_FRMBASE` VENC input **encodes at the full sensor
  rate** — so Maruko stab-fill uses the same manual-feed shape as Star6E; no
  SCL bridge or FRAME_BASE bind needed.
- Graph rewire (only when `framing == "stab-fill"`): SCL port0 → RAW +
  unbound, drained by the fill thread; VENC created `NORMAL` (frame-base)
  with `StartRecvPic` deferred to post-graph; no VENC ring pool. `off`/`zoom`/
  `stab` keep the zero-copy RING leg untouched. Requires the unbound VENC
  input port to be given `MI_SYS_SetChnInputPortFrc(USERINJECT, fps/fps)`.
- Fill loop (in `maruko_framing_stab.c`, second registered module sharing the
  detector/Kalman/`stab_accuracy` with `stab`): drain port0 → detect on the
  centre patch → Kalman → compose (shift + Y=16/UV=128 borders) via
  `MI_SYS_BufBlitPa`/`BufFillPa` (present on i6c, leading-SocId signatures) →
  push. Measured: detect 5.2 ms + compose 3.0 ms ≈ **5.8 ms/frame thread CPU**
  (~29% of the single A7 at 50 fps) at `stab_accuracy=low`.
- `stab_crop_pct` is the float/border budget (max_off = enc·(100−pct)/200 per
  side); `pause_stab` glide-home works unchanged.
- WebUI: `stab-fill` un-gated on Maruko (reverses the #165 disable); tooltip
  updated. `record.mode=dual` is refused under stab-fill (chn 1 is RING-fed —
  can't mix with a frame-base chn 0 on the one H26x device).
- The 5a probe's BufConf ABI is corrected in-tree so the archived bench now
  reports the true answer.

Reinit hardening (found by adversarial resolution/sensor-mode switch testing
with the stab presets active — ~40 API-driven reinit switches on `.233`):

- **Two-phase stab teardown (BOTH presets).** Joining the consumer thread of a
  user-drained SCL port (fill: port0; stab: the port-2 tap) while the camera
  still produces pins SCL/ISP working tasks, and the ISP→SCL REALTIME unbind's
  UNBOUNDED kernel flush then wedges in uninterruptible D-state
  (`MI_SYS_IMPL_FlushRealTimeOutputBuf`) — ending as a zombie process or a
  hardware-watchdog reset.  Device-reproduced from stab-fill AND plain stab on
  size/preset switches; retroactively explains the 2026-07-03 teardown hangs.
  Now: `framing_stop` flips the thread to drain-only (no IVE/compose, pure
  GetBuf/PutBuf) so consumption continues while the ports are disabled;
  teardown joins + sweeps the residue afterwards (`finish_stop`).  Cut the
  wedge incidence from ~1-in-2 (fill) to <1-in-20 across the switch barrage.
- **Teardown watchdog (roadmap item, now shipped).** The residual SDK race is
  GENERIC and pre-existing — control test: `framing=off` wedged on its first
  size-change reinit, no stab code in the path (matches the 2026-07-03 hangs
  and the factory binary wedging identically).  It cannot be closed from
  userspace ordering, so a watchdog armed at teardown entry forces
  `reboot(RB_AUTOBOOT)` after 12 s if teardown has not completed — a bounded,
  logged, self-recovering ~45 s reboot instead of open-ended D-state limbo
  (no sysrq on I6C; SIGKILL leaves an MI zombie).  Benefits every mode, not
  just the stab presets.
- **Live fps change under stab-fill fixed.** `maruko_apply_fps` re-bound
  SCL→VENC RING as its fps divider — on the frame-base manual-fed VENC that
  stalls the encoder dead (instant "no encoder data" abort, device-reproduced).
  In fill mode the divider is now the VENC input port's USERINJECT FRC
  (src:dst), applied live with no graph change.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-07-09

Stabilization: **`video0.stab_accuracy` — a shared high/medium/low detector
level, replacing the silent per-backend divergence.** The Shift_Detector
geometry (crop/box/pyramid/search) was hardcoded differently in each backend
(Star6E 384/256/3, Maruko 256/128/2) — invisible to users and impossible to
tune per sensor mode.

- New enum field `video0.stab_accuracy = auto | high | medium | low`, shared by
  both backends and by both stab presets (`stab` + `stab-fill`). One geometry
  table in `include/framing_stab_accuracy.h` — the two backends now resolve
  through it, so they cannot drift again.
  - **high** 384/256/3/96 (smoothest) · **medium** 320/192/3/80 (new middle
    step) · **low** 256/128/2/64 (cheapest). All keep margin = (crop−box)/2 =
    64px. The detector is NEON software, so the level is the CPU/quality lever.
- **`auto` (default) resolves per-backend** — high on Star6E, low on
  single-core Maruko — so an unset field reproduces each backend's previous
  behaviour exactly (zero regression on upgrade).
- Data-driven WebUI: the field carries `FieldUi` metadata (`control:"select"`),
  so the dashboard renders the dropdown straight from `/api/v1/capabilities` —
  no `dashboard.html` edit or webui-blob rebuild. Supported on both backends
  (no Maruko gate); MUT_RESTART.
- Tests: `tests/test_framing_stab_accuracy.c` pins the level table, the 64px
  margin invariant, per-backend `auto` resolution and lenient unknown→fallback;
  plus config load + API set/validate guards. Suite 1744/0.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-07-09

Maruko (Infinity6C): **`video0.framing = "stab"` — IVE stabilization on i6c,
at parity with Star6E.** The motion detector (`MI_IVE_Shift_Detector`) was
previously dead on Maruko (`MI_IVE_Create` failed); the root cause was a
userspace blob vintage mismatch, not a kernel bug.

- **Blob unblock:** swap **only** `libmi_ive.so` for the BSP uClibc build
  (md5 `d608368e`, ive tag `c6a1e30`), which does its IC-version check via
  `/dev/mstar_ive0` ioctls instead of raw-mmapping `/dev/mem` (which EINVALs
  on this firmware). Do **not** also swap `libmi_sys`/`libmi_common` — the BSP
  variants segfault on the musl rootfs. Delivered as a builder osdrv override
  (builder#24).
- **Cost model, stated honestly:** the detector is SigmaStar's NEON software
  vision lib (`Simd::Neon`), **not** HW-accelerated — ~17 ms/call on one A7.
  i6c is single-core, so the config is cheapened to 256 tap / 128 box / 2-level
  pyramid (core 100%→55%, keeps 50 fps) at a documented noise cost.
- **Shared Kalman:** the control law is extracted to `framing_kalman.{c,h}`,
  linked by both backends; the Star6E refactor onto it is proven bit-identical
  by `tests/test_framing_kalman.c`. Maruko stabilizes in the SCL-input domain
  (crop + center-tap share one surface — simpler than Star6E's precrop path).
- **Teardown:** the detector thread is joined **before** the tap port is
  disabled (avoids an MI_SYS MMU-callback storm → watchdog); verified clean
  across repeated start/stop cycles, zero MMU resets.
- **Knobs un-gated on Maruko:** `stab_crop_pct`, `recenter_speed`,
  `stab_kalman_q`, `stab_kalman_r`, `pause_stab` now validate/apply and the
  WebUI no longer greys them out. `pause_stab` glides the frame home.
- **`framing = "stab-fill"` is planned, not yet shipped** on Maruko — it hinges
  on whether the i6c VENC accepts manually pushed input frames (RING_DMA-fed
  today); see `specs/2026-07-08-maruko-stab/plan.md` Phase 5.

## [0.34.1] - 2026-07-09

Star6E IMX335: **true 144fps encode — decouple VENC delivery from the RC
fpsNum parameter.** Supersedes the earlier cap-to-120 approach.

- The i6e VENC encodes 143fps fine; the 120 ceiling is only on the
  rate-control `fpsNum` parameter — `_MI_VENC_VerifyFps` rejects RC fps > 120
  and silently resets it to 30, wrecking CBR (3000 kbps → ~15 Mbps at 143fps).
- Fix: deliver the **true** sensor rate to VENC (encodes 143) but cap only the
  RC `fpsNum` to `STAR6E_VENC_INPUT_FPS_MAX` (120) so `VerifyFps` never resets.
  `rc_fps=120` vs `143` delivered = ~1.19× CBR overshoot (QP normal regime)
  instead of 4.7×.
- `star6e_pipeline.c`: create-path `venc_fps` (RC) capped to 120; both
  `bind_dst` deliver the true rate; GOP from the capped RC fps (240).
  `star6e_controls.c`: `apply_fps()` bind dst = true fps,
  `apply_encoder_fps(rc_fps)`.
- Device-verified (fps=144): RC SrcFrmRate 120/1, actual Fps_1s 143.0, no
  VerifyFps reset, wire ~4080–4188 kbps. Optional follow-up: bitrate
  compensation ×120/143 for exact CBR.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-07-06

Star6E IMX415: **hide four modes from the SDK/WebUI enumeration while keeping
them compiled in the driver.**

- New `imx415_linear_visible[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}` maps table indices to the
  SDK-enumerated list. The capability loop enumerates only those (so `num_res`
  = 5) and `pCus_SetVideoRes()` maps the SDK index back to the table index,
  re-asserting `ulcur_res`. All 9 mode tables and dispatch cases stay compiled
  — re-enabling a hidden mode is a one-line edit (add its table index back).
- **Visible (5, fps-ordered):** 0:3840×2160@40, 1:2816×1584@60, 2:1920×1080@90,
  3:1728×972@100, 4:1728×816@120.
- **Hidden (4, kept in driver):** table idx 0 (4K@30), 3 (3840×1152@60),
  5 (2304×1296@100), 7 (1472×816@120).
- **Note:** the SDK-enumerated indices shifted (now 0–4). Configs referencing
  the old 0–8 indices must be remapped — e.g. the bench box `/etc/waybeam.json`
  moved `"mode": 6` → `"mode": 3` to keep 1728×972@100. Device-verified on .13:
  enumerates 5 modes, mode 3 runs clean at 100fps, 0 drops.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-07-05

Star6E IMX415: **removed the two image-corrupt full-FOV binned modes** and settled
on a clean 9-mode fps-ordered lineup.

- Removed **1920×1080@100** and **1920×1080@120** (full-FOV 2×2-binned). They
  reported correct fps but rendered black + colored horizontal lines on the I6E
  ISP — to reach 100/120fps their HMAX drops to 328/275, below the wide binned
  line's WINMODE=0x04 crop floor (~365). Init tables, thunks, enum entries, mode
  rows and dispatch cases all deleted (no dead code).
- **Kept 1920×1080@90** (full-FOV 2×2-binned, idx4): at 90fps HMAX stays above the
  crop floor, so it renders a clean image — device-confirmed.
- Final lineup (idx : res@fps): 0:4K@30, 1:4K@40, 2:2816×1584@60, 3:3840×1152@60,
  4:1920×1080@90, 5:2304×1296@100, 6:1728×972@100, 7:1472×816@120, 8:1728×816@120.
  Every mode renders a valid image; still strict fps order.
- Docs (`STAR6E_IMX415_MODES.md`, `HEADROOM.md` §5.6) updated to match.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-05

Star6E IMX415: **strict fps ordering** of the full 11-mode lineup. No behaviour
change per mode — only the resolution-table order and dispatch case indices were
permuted so `sensor.mode` steps monotonically in frame rate.

New index map (old → new): 0→0, 1→2, 2→4, 3→5, 4→6, 5→8, 6→9, 7→3, 8→1, 9→7,
10→10. Resulting order (idx : res@fps): 0:4K@30, 1:4K@40, 2:2816×1584@60,
3:3840×1152@60, 4:1920×1080@90, 5:2304×1296@100, 6:1920×1080@100, 7:1728×972@100,
8:1472×816@120, 9:1920×1080@120, 10:1728×816@120.

- The `imx415_mipi_linear[]` rows and the `pCus_SetVideoRes` cases were reordered
  together; each case keeps its exact init table / vts_30fps / fps / line_period /
  data_prec. Verified: `.ko` mode strings now enumerate in fps-ascending order.
- The full-FOV binned corruption warning (idx4/6/9 in the new numbering) is
  restated in the driver header and docs.
- Doc tables (`STAR6E_IMX415_MODES.md`) re-sorted to match; narrative
  sub-sections retain original-order idx labels (flagged inline) and identify
  modes by resolution.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-05

Star6E IMX415: two **binned wide-crop** modes (idx9/idx10) that give the widest
2×2-binned FOV which renders *clean* at 100/120fps, plus the diagnosis of why
full-FOV 1920×1080 binned is corrupt on the I6E ISP.

- **1728×972@100fps 2×2-binned wide crop** (`Sensor_bc1728_100fps_init_table_
  4lane_linear`, idx9) — widest binned FOV (~80% of full-4K linear) that renders
  clean at 100fps. HMAX=365, VMAX=2034, 891 link. Image-verified on the display.
- **1728×816@120fps 2×2-binned wide crop** (`Sensor_bc1728_120fps_init_table_
  4lane_linear`, idx10) — same 1728 width at 120fps. Height capped at 816 because
  120fps forces HMAX=365/VMAX=1700 and a taller frame drops HMAX below the crop
  floor. 17% wider than the idx5 1472×816 crop. Image-verified.
- **Root-caused the black+colored-lines corruption**: the full-FOV 1920×1080
  binned modes (idx2/4/6) report correct fps but render garbage on the I6E ISP —
  the `WINMODE=0x04` crop path needs `HMAX ≥ ~365` for a wide binned line. A
  1728-wide crop clears this; the 1920-wide full-FOV readout does not (its
  reduced-HMAX≈308/328 falls below the floor → malformed readout). The binned
  wide-crops keep HMAX=365 and stay clean. idx2/4/6 retained only for
  stock-index compatibility; use idx9/idx10 for high-FOV binned video.
- Both new modes clone the device-proven idx5 1472×816 crop (`WINMODE=0x04` +
  explicit centered window) and widen it, changing only the window + VMAX/HMAX.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-05

Star6E IMX415: a **native 3840×2160@40fps** full-4K mode (idx8), appended
alongside the lineup (indices 0–7 unchanged), plus the resolution of the
ISP/CSI-clock investigation.

- **3840×2160@40fps full 4K** (`Sensor_8m_40fps_init_table_4lane_linear`, idx8)
  — native 4K at 40fps, +33% over the stock idx0 4K@30. Non-binned on the 1485
  link, full-height window (VST=0/VWIDTH=4320), VMAX=2250, HMAX=825 (332 MPix/s).
  Device-verified on `.13`: sensor=enqueue=delivered=40.8fps, 0 drops, 0
  steady-state FIFO-FULL.
- This is the **clean full-4K ceiling**. Bench probes established the two walls
  just above it: 4K@42 (HMAX=779, 352 MPix/s) hits the ISP throughput wall
  (FIFO-FULL, ~7% loss); 4K@45 (HMAX=733) breaches the sensor's analog HMAX
  floor (733<floor≤779) with a clean silent halve. Neither is clock-fixable.
- **ISP/CSI-clock lever — resolved as unavailable on i6e.** The Maruko/i6c 288MHz
  CSI-MAC lever does not port: this SoC's vendor CSI driver rejects
  `CUS_CSI_CLK_288M` (dmesg `[Drv_CSISetClk] Not supported CSI CLK 288000` →
  sensor never powers on). 216M is the hard CSI ceiling; the driver pins it for
  all modes with an explanatory comment. See
  `documentation/STAR6E_IMX415_HEADROOM.md` §5.3-5.4.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-07-05

Star6E IMX415: an **ultrawide 3840×1152@60fps** mode (idx7) — full sensor
*width* at 60fps, appended alongside the lineup (indices 0–6 unchanged).

- **3840×1152@60fps ultrawide** (`Sensor_uw_3840x1152_60_init_table_4lane_linear`,
  idx7) — 100% horizontal FOV, letterboxed to 1152 lines (3.33:1), non-binned
  on the 1485 link. Built on idx1's 1485 base with the window widened to full
  3840 and height cropped to 1152; HMAX=1022 (idx0's proven full-width line, so
  no analog-floor risk), VMAX=1211 → 60fps, which clears the vertical wall
  (1211 ≥ 1152 physical + vblank) and the ISP wall (265 MPix/s). Device-verified
  59.98fps, 0 drops, 0 FIFO-FULL over a 15 s soak (`incrop 0,0,3840,1152`).
  Height is HMAX-bounded to ~1160; a taller 3840×1296 (2.96:1) would need
  HMAX≈917 (below idx0's line, ISP at ~299 MPix/s) — a riskier stretch, left
  out. See `STAR6E_IMX415_HEADROOM.md`.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-05

Star6E IMX415: a **full-FOV 2×2-binned 1920×1080@120fps** mode (idx6), added
alongside the existing lineup (indices 0–5 unchanged).

- **1920×1080@120fps full-FOV binned** (`Sensor_2m_120fps_init_table_4lane_linear`,
  appended at idx6) — the full sensor FOV at 120fps (soft), a full-FOV
  alternative to the stock 1472×816@120 crop (idx5, kept). Same reduced-HMAX
  approach as idx4, one notch faster: HMAX=275 (line 3712 ns) with VMAX=2250,
  which sits just above the full-width binned analog HMAX floor (~250–275;
  HMAX=229 halves at 144fps). This is the practical full-FOV binned ceiling —
  the ISP (249 MPix/s) would allow more, but the sensor's line-readout floor
  caps it near 120–130fps. Device-verified 120.15fps, 0 drops, 0 FIFO-FULL over
  a 20 s soak. See `STAR6E_IMX415_HEADROOM.md` for the full model.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-07-05

Star6E IMX415: a **full-FOV 2×2-binned 1920×1080@100fps** mode, and a **widened
2816×1584@60fps** replacing the old 2560×1440. Both device-verified on .13.

- **1920×1080@100fps full-FOV binned** (`drivers/sensor_imx415_star6e.c`,
  `Sensor_2m_100fps_init_table_4lane_linear`, inserted fps-ordered at idx4) —
  the *full sensor FOV* at 100fps (soft/binned), complementing the sharp
  non-binned 2304×1296@100 (idx3) at the same fps. Device-verified 100.00 fps,
  0 drops over a 30 s soak, warm-switch clean both directions.
  The obstacle was the **binned vertical-timing wall**, not bandwidth or the ISP
  MPix ceiling: a binned readout's VMAX must cover the *physical* lines read
  (2×output_h = 2160) plus vblank, so at the stock binned HMAX=365 a 100fps
  frame caps VMAX at ~2023 < 2160 and the VIF silently delivers *exactly half*
  (~50 fps, DropCnt=0). Fix = the same reduced-HMAX trick as the non-binned
  modes: HMAX 365→**328** lets VMAX be 2250 (=2160+90 vblank, matching the stock
  90fps mode) at 100fps. Bit depth (10 vs 12bpp) and link (891 vs 1485) were
  both ruled out as red herrings before the timing wall was identified.
- **2816×1584@60fps** (idx1, widened from 2560×1440) — the stock 60fps table
  already reads a 2952×1656 window but venc center-cropped it to 2560×1440,
  discarding FOV. Widening the output to 2816×1584 (mode-table only, no sensor
  register change) lifts FOV area from ~44% to ~58% of the sensor. Held at
  ~2816-wide (267 MPix/s) rather than the full 2952 (293 MPix/s, startup
  FIFO-FULL) to leave ISP headroom for the OSD overlay. Verified 59.52 fps,
  0 drops, 0 steady-state FIFO-FULL.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-05

Star6E IMX415: a new **non-binned 2304×1296@100fps** window-crop mode, plus
warm-switch register safety. Follows the 0.25.0 in-tree Star6E drivers.

- **2304×1296@100fps non-binned** (`drivers/sensor_imx415_star6e.c`, inserted
  fps-ordered at idx3) — the widest 16:9 the I6E ISP sustains non-binned at
  100fps: 2.99 MPix / ~299 MPix/s, device-verified 99.0 fps + 0 drops over a
  30 s soak. Challenges the "must bin for FOV at high fps" assumption: native
  sharp resolution (35% FOV area) where the stock 90/120 modes are 2×2 binned.
  Enabled by (1) the 1485 Mbps link (`SYS_MODE=0x08`, reused from idx1's base,
  no venc changes — Star6E's REALTIME bind carries it), (2) a **reduced HMAX**
  (548) to beat the vertical-timing wall a fixed HMAX=652 would cap at ~89fps,
  and (3) the I6E ISP sustaining ~300 MPix/s. The wall was device-mapped:
  2304×1296 clean, 2432×1368 (333 MPix/s) drops, 2560×1440 halves.
- **Warm-switch register safety** — the SDK keeps sensor registers across a
  mode switch, and the stock non-binned tables (idx0/idx1) never wrote the
  binning registers, so a warm switch binned→non-binned (e.g. 90→30) left 2×2
  binning latched and corrupted the readout. The non-binned idx0/idx1 tables
  and the new crop now write `0x3020/21/22=0x00` + all-pixel DIG_CLP
  (`0x30D9=0x06`/`0x30DA=0x02`) explicitly in standby. Verified both
  directions, 0 drops (120→30, 90→100, 120→60, 90→30).

## [0.25.0] - 2026-07-05

In-tree Star6E (Infinity6E) sensor drivers for IMX335 and IMX415 — the Star6E
counterpart to the Maruko custom drivers. Previously Star6E had only prebuilt
stock `.ko`; now the mode lineups are owned in-repo and buildable via
`make drivers-star6e KSRC_STAR6E=<i6e-4.9.84-kernel>`. Both seeded from the
OpenIPC infinity6e blueprints, HDR/DOL removed (the two HDR handles are `NULL`
and the SEF handle made `static`, so the compiler dead-code-eliminates the
whole HDR subtree). Device-verified on SSC338Q @192.168.1.13, 0 sustained
drops on every mode.

- **IMX335 — fps-ordered lineup with two new higher-FOV window-crop tiers**
  (`drivers/sensor_imx335_star6e.c`, `documentation/STAR6E_IMX335_MODES.md`):
  2560×1920@30 / @60, 2400×1350@90, **2176×1224@100** (new crop, VIF 99.8),
  1920×1080@120, **1600×900@144** (new crop, VIF 143.3). The two crops push to
  the highest FOV the I6E ISP sustains — measured ceiling ≈2.66 MPix@100 /
  ≈1.44 MPix@144; over budget the ISP silently halves (0 fifo/skip logged), so
  the VIF `/proc` FPS column is the truth signal. The Maruko I6C ceiling model
  does not apply to I6E. No 50fps mode. `imx335_init_window_crop()` reuses the
  proven 120fps analog/PLL base and overrides only the readout window + HMAX,
  latching the geometry in standby (PR#156 discipline).
- **IMX415 — stock fps-ordered lineup** (`drivers/sensor_imx415_star6e.c`,
  `documentation/STAR6E_IMX415_MODES.md`): 3840×2160@30, 2560×1440@60,
  1920×1080@90, 1472×816@120. Stock tables verbatim; no crop tiers.
- **Build wiring** (`drivers/Makefile`, `Makefile`): `SOC=star6e` obj-m builds
  both sensor objects; `make drivers-star6e` stages
  `sensors/star6e/sensor_imx*_star6e.ko`.

Note: venc persists `sensor.mode` in `/etc/waybeam.json`. These drivers expose
fewer modes than the stock 11-mode IMX415 driver, so a persisted mode index
beyond the new range makes venc fail mode-select and exit on boot — patch the
config to a valid index when deploying over a box that ran the stock driver.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-07-04

Pre-upstream-squash cleanup: adversarial review of the 0.22.0–0.24.0 range
(PRs #157–#160) surfaced a handful of straggling defects, all fixed here.
No functional feature changes.

- **GOP frame count now tracks the *actual* encoder fps, not the committed
  request** (`src/venc_api.c`) — a live `video0.fps` above the current sensor
  mode's max is clamped to `sensor_fps` for the bind, but the GOP was computed
  from the unclamped value, stretching the I-frame interval (e.g. GOP for 144
  while the encoder is pinned at 100 → 1.44 s instead of 1 s). Now uses
  `query_live_fps()`; the 120→144 ceiling raise had widened this drift.
- **Star6E debug-OSD "enc" row no longer shows `0x0`** (`src/star6e_runtime.c`)
  — it printed the raw `video0.width/height` config (default `0/0` = auto)
  instead of the resolved `image_width/height`; Maruko already did it right.
- **AE pacer teardown join is now bounded** (`src/maruko_pipeline.c`) — the
  pacer's steady-state loop calls `CUS3A_RunOnce`, which can stall inside the
  SDK during an ISP fault; the previous unbounded `pthread_join` would then
  wedge teardown/respawn. Now `pthread_timedjoin_np` (300 ms) + detach-on-
  timeout. Device-verified: 0 spurious timeouts across mode-cycle teardowns.
- **Star6E fps rebind restores on encoder-apply failure**
  (`src/star6e_controls.c`) — a post-bind encoder/scene fps write failure no
  longer leaves VPE→VENC bound at the new fps while the caller rolls back.
- **CPU% debug-OSD window corrected to the documented ~1 s**
  (`src/debug_osd.c`, `OSD_CPU_RING` 3→2 — was a 1.5 s span).
- **Removed the retired `throttle_mode` AE controller** (`src/maruko_cus3a.c`,
  `include/maruko_cus3a.h`) — the 0.9.12 "aeEngine=custom" log-domain IIR
  controller and its `MarukoAeResult`/`SetAeParam` plumbing were dead
  (`throttle_mode` hard-wired off since paced native 3A superseded it). The
  supervisory thread is now cleanly limits-only. Device-verified on I6C: native
  AE still enforces `isp.gainMax`, reads stats, adapts exposure, and tears down
  clean across mode cycles.
- **Upstream hygiene**: dropped `.serena/` tooling config from tracking (now
  gitignored) and four transient handoff/investigation docs.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-07-04

IMX335 gets a **144fps ultra-low-latency mode** + a `WAYBEAM_NO_3A` debug
toggle. Full mode detail: `documentation/MARUKO_IMX335_MODES.md`.

- **New mode 5 = 1536x864@144 (16:9)** — device-verified clean end-to-end on
  SSC378QE + IMX335: SCL 144.0 fps, VENC 143.4 fps, **0 DropCnt / 0 FIFO-FULL /
  0 Skip-IQ**. Reuses the proven 120fps analog window (HMAX=275, `imx335_geo_
  1536x864`), VMAX paced to 144 (`vts_30fps=1875`). The lowest-latency mode in
  the lineup (6.94 ms frame period).

- **Why 1536x864 and not larger** — 144fps is bound by TWO independent ISP
  walls, both device-proven: (a) **bandwidth** ~274 MPix/s — 1920x1080@144 =
  298 MPix/s overflows the ISP P0 FIFO and collapses to ~26 fps; (b) **per-frame
  time** T ≈ 1.7 ms fixed + 3.65 ns/px vs the 6.94 ms frame period — 1600x900
  (1.44 MP, ~6.96 ms) misses by ~1% and Skip-IQ stalls. Both limits are at the
  ISP *input*, so an output/SCL downscale rescues neither; the sensor readout
  window itself must shrink. 1536x864 (1.33 MP) sits under both.

- **`WAYBEAM_NO_3A=1` env var** (`src/maruko_pipeline.c`) — freezes 3A entirely
  (`CUS3A_SetRunMode(OFF)`, no pacer/supervisory) for bench diagnosis. Used to
  prove the fixed per-frame ISP cost is **not** reclaimable by disabling 3A
  (1600x900@144 still stalls with 3A frozen — the ~1.7 ms is vendor ISP pixel
  processing, not 3A). Exposure is static when set; bench use only.

- **Live `video0.fps` accepts up to 144** (`PIPELINE_LIVE_FPS_MAX`,
  `include/pipeline_common.h`; `maruko_apply_fps`, star6e `apply_fps`) — the
  live-apply path previously hard-rejected any `fps > 120`, making it
  impossible to *pre-stage* fps=144 while parked in a lower-fps mode (so the
  next respawn's auto sensor-select could pick the 144 mode). The request is no
  longer rejected: the requested value is committed to config, and each
  platform's existing clamp-to-`sensor_fps` caps the actual VPE→VENC rebind to
  the current mode's max — so a 100fps mode still binds at 100, but the config
  now carries 144 for `sensor.mode:-1` to resolve on the next mode switch
  (`sensor_mode_clamp_fps` re-clamps there too). 144 is the ceiling because it
  is the highest fps any mode offers; above it is still a client error.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-04

Maruko IMX335 best-per-fps mode lineup + debug-OSD readouts. Full mode
detail: `documentation/MARUKO_IMX335_MODES.md`.

- **IMX335 gets a 5-mode best-per-fps lineup**, porting the IMX415 method
  to the 4:3 5MP sensor. One mode per fps tier, native 4:3 aspect for
  0–3, 16:9 low-latency hero at 100 fps:

  | idx | resolution | fps | aspect | role |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | 2592x1944 | 30 | 4:3 | full-res all-pixel (best IQ / full FOV) |
  | 1 | 2496x1872 | 50 | 4:3 | center crop |
  | 2 | 2272x1704 | 60 | 4:3 | center crop |
  | 3 | 1792x1344 | 90 | 4:3 | center crop |
  | 4 | 1920x1080 | 100 | 16:9 | low-latency hero (REALTIME) |

  All device-verified on SSC378QE + IMX335. **Window mode works on I6C** —
  the old "windowed readout hangs the ISP" claim was a stale-register
  artifact. Each crop writes its full readout geometry
  (HTRIM/HNUM/Y_OUT/AREA3/HMAX) explicitly in standby
  (`imx335_init_window_crop`), reusing the proven 120fps analog config;
  geometry is derived exact from the 1920x1080 window mode. Crop sizes sit
  ~5–8% under the ISP throughput ceiling (~245–274 MPix/s); all bind
  REALTIME for minimum latency.
- **BREAKING `sensor.mode` remap** — dropped the two redundant 16:9
  1920x1080@60/@90 modes (60/90 are now the higher-res 4:3 crops) and
  renumbered. Pinned `sensor.mode` configs must be updated; `sensor.mode:
  -1` (auto) resolves by target dims and needs no change.
- **Cold-boot enum wedge documented**: repeated `reboot -f` after a hung
  teardown can leave IMX335 i2c enumeration wedged (`QueryResCount → 0`,
  every mode fails "not available on pad", mode-independent). Recovery is a
  power-cycle; graceful `reboot` avoids it. Not a geometry bug.
- **Debug OSD gains sensor + encode readouts** (both Maruko and Star6E):
  two fixed rows below `cpu` — `snr <WxH>@<fps> m<idx>` (sensor readout +
  mode index) and `enc <WxH> <codec>` — so a tester can read the live mode
  straight off the overlay. Inserted at rows 2–3; the AE/AWB/exp block
  shifts down, nothing clobbered.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-07-04

Maruko AE rework: **paced native 3A** replaces both historical AE engines.
Full investigation: `documentation/MARUKO_CUS3A_INJECT_HANDOFF.md`.

- **Maruko now runs ONE AE mode**: the vendor AE+AWB converge at full rate
  for ~3 s after pipeline start, then the CUS3A per-frame auto-run is
  paused (`CUS3A_SetRunMode(OFF)`) and a pacer thread re-runs the same
  converged algo via `CUS3A_RunOnce` at `sensor_fps/3` (floor 30 Hz).
  Applies keep flowing through the stock ISP-API agent path.
  Device-measured @1080p100: 70.0% of the core (old `sdk` full-rate) /
  52.8% (old `custom` throttle) → **39.4%**, at full vendor image quality
  (exposure + AWB convergence verified live, below majestic's 42.9%).
- **`isp.aeEngine` is retired on Maruko** (still honored on Star6E). The
  key still parses so existing configs load; `custom` logs a notice and
  behaves as paced. The 0.9.12 no-op AE adaptor + P1 throttle controller
  path is removed. `isp.aeFps` keeps governing only the supervisory
  limits thread (Star6E semantics unchanged).
- Pacer rate is auto-derived — no user knob: 100 fps → 33 Hz,
  90 fps → 30 Hz, ≤90 fps → 30 Hz floor (full-rate quality at low fps).
- **`isp.gainMax` fixes** (found live-testing gain headroom): (1) the
  supervisory limits thread now compares against a fresh
  `GetExposureLimit` read each tick instead of a local cache — the CUS3A
  AE init was silently resetting limits to bin values right after the
  startup push, so a config `gainMax` above the bin ceiling never stuck;
  (2) the live `isp.gainMax` API setter now routes through the
  supervisory target (`maruko_cus3a_set_gain_max`) instead of writing
  the raw limit — writing `0` ("bin default") used to push a literal
  0 limit and slam the image black.  Verified live on-device:
  32000 → sgain rises past the bin's 8192 (to the algo's internal
  ~11470 cap), 2048 → clamps down, 0 → returns to bin default 8192.
- Findings for posterity: CUS3A INJECT run-mode makes the agent mid-layer
  silently drop every exposure apply (do not revisit); `CUS3A_RunOnceEn`
  only arms algo selection while `CUS3A_RunOnce` executes synchronously in
  the caller; `MI_ISP_RegisterIspApiAgent` is pure userspace fp tables.
- **Debug OSD: smoothed CPU% + live AE/AWB readouts.** The CPU% readout
  is now a sliding ~1 s average (snapshot ring at 500 ms cadence) instead
  of a jumpy 500 ms delta; the duplicated per-platform `/proc/stat`
  sampler in `debug_osd.c` is folded into one shared implementation
  (both Star6E and Maruko). Maruko additionally gains three OSD rows,
  refreshed at 1 Hz, to watch the paced 3A adapt live:
  `exp` (shutter µs, sensor gain/limit, ISP gain), `ae` (measured luma
  vs scene target, stable/adj/bound state, pacer Hz), and `awb`
  (R/B gains, color temp, stable/adj) — backed by a new
  `maruko_controls_ae_osd_status()` reusing the `/api/v1/ae/info` +
  `/api/v1/awb/info` SDK queries.
- **Review-pass hardening** (adversarial multi-agent review of the above):
  (1) the `ae` OSD row is now gated on a distinct `ae_info_valid` flag so
  it no longer renders fabricated zeros when only the sensor-plane query
  answers (the `exp` row keeps its sensor-plane fallback); (2) the AE
  pacer now requires all three CUS3A symbols (`RunOnceEn`/`RunOnce`/
  `SetRunMode`) before engaging — a missing `RunOnceEn` falls back to
  vendor full-rate instead of pausing auto-run and ticking an unarmed
  `RunOnce` (frozen 3A); (3) the pacer's 3 s convergence wait is now an
  interruptible 50 ms poll of `g_inj_run`, so a teardown/respawn in the
  first 3 s joins in ≤50 ms instead of blocking the whole window — matters
  on this restart-latency-sensitive SoC. Device-verified: pacer
  re-derives 33 Hz on live switch to 1080p100, both OSD rows show valid
  data, ~48% busy with OSD active.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-03

Maruko IMX415 mode-lineup rework: one best mode per FPS tier, all non-binned
and ~16:9 (sensor native aspect). See `documentation/MARUKO_IMX415_1485_MODES.md`.

- **BREAKING: `sensor.mode` index remap** (Maruko IMX415). New lineup:
  0 = `3760x2116@30fps` (891, REALTIME), 1 = `2952x1656@50fps_1485`,
  2 = `2688x1512@60fps_1485` (NEW — exact 16:9, replaces 2952x1368 19.4:9),
  3 = `2112x1184@90fps_1485`, 4 = `1920x1080@100fps_1485` (NEW).
  Old→new: 0→0, 5→1, 7→3. Configs with a pinned mode index must be updated;
  `sensor.mode: -1` (auto) resolves correctly unchanged.
- **New 100 fps tier replaces the vendor 120 fps mode**: `1920x1080@100_1485`
  is non-binned, exact 16:9, and sized ~8% under the ISP m2m ceiling
  (capacity ~108 fps) so the FRAMEBASE queue stays empty — minimum latency
  at full nominal rate. The old binned 1472x816@120 never delivered 120
  (115–118 measured): its HMAX=365 table bursts 393 MPix/s, above the
  384 MPix/s ISP REALTIME drain.
- **Vendor superwide + binned modes unsurfaced** (superwide 3760x1024@59,
  binned 1080p60-ispsafe, binned 1080p90, 1472x816@120): tables parked
  under `#if 0` in the driver for posterity; all suffered either non-16:9
  geometry or the 393 MPix/s FIFO-pressure defect.
- CSI-MAC clock selection now keyed on a per-mode `link_mbps` field instead
  of a hardcoded index threshold (renumber-safe; the FRAMEBASE bind was
  already keyed on the `_1485` name suffix).
- **`video0.size` width alignment relaxed /16 → /8.** The former rule
  (#63/#55, derived from an 854×480 failure that is only ÷2) needlessly
  rejected native ÷8 widths like 2952. Mode 1's `2952x1656` may now be set
  explicitly instead of only via `auto`; forcing the nearest /16 (2944)
  anamorphically downscaled 2952→2944 and cost ~7 fps (43 vs 50, device-
  verified). Height /8 unchanged. HEVC's conformance window covers the
  sub-CTU remainder, so /8 is the correct minimum.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-03

Maruko (Infinity6C/SSC378QE) IMX415 1485 Mbps non-binned sensor modes, plus
the operational fixes discovered while bringing them up on hardware. Full
platform notes in `documentation/MARUKO_IMX415_1485_MODES.md`.

- **Three new sensor modes** (indexes 5–7): `2952x1656@50fps_1485` (1:1 5MP),
  `2952x1368@60fps_1485` (ISP-ceiling max @60), `2112x1184@90fps_1485`
  (ISP-ceiling max @90). Requires CSI-MAC clock 288 MHz (set in `poweron`
  for mode index ≥ 5) and a mode-conditional VIF→ISP bind: FRAMEBASE for
  `_1485` modes (REALTIME overflows the ISP input FIFO at 594 MPix/s line
  bursts), REALTIME retained for 891 modes (minimum latency).
- **Sensor register-state hardening**: 1485 and non-binned 891 tables now
  write the readout-mode registers explicitly (`0x3020/21/22`, `0x30D9/DA`)
  — the IMX415 latches binning across teardown and warm reboot, which
  previously wedged every warm binned→1485 switch until a power-cycle.
  Vendor 1485 table's `0x3032=0x00` dark-image bug fixed (`0x01`).
- **Mode 2 (1920x1080@60 binned) frame-rate fix**: the ISP-safe HMAX
  rework (HMAX=1100) could not deliver 60 fps at all — in 2x2 binning
  VMAX counts physical lines (~2250 minimum for 1080p output), which at
  a 14.8 µs line is 30 fps; the stored `vts_30fps=2250` shipped exactly
  that under a 60 fps label. Now HMAX=550 (7.407 µs line): VMAX=2250 →
  device-measured 60.0 fps, line burst 259 MPix/s (safely under the
  384 MPix/s ISP drain that FIFO-FULLed the vendor HMAX=365 table).
- **Teardown drain**: poll SCL/ISP output-port task counts (worst row
  across all ports) before unbind so the kernel's unbounded REALTIME/RING
  flush isn't entered with in-flight tasks that can no longer complete
  (D-state hang observed after long runs; drain is bounded + advisory).
- **Honest keep_aspect on Maruko**: true width crops are impossible on the
  I6C camera path (SCL output crop must match ring stride; RDMA input crop
  needs a FRAMEBASE producer bind that mi_sys refuses on ISP→SCL) — wide →
  narrow-AR now anamorphically squeezes full sensor width with a one-line
  startup notice (>2% width delta), height crops still honored, AE zoom
  crop normalized against full ISP dims, zoom windows confined to the
  keep_aspect framing surface. Star6E is unaffected (VIF capture-window
  crop remains a real crop there).

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-02

Remove the SDK VENC frame-lost strategy entirely — config field, live plumbing,
and the `MI_VENC_SetFrameLostStrategy` dlopen bindings on both backends.

Device testing on Star6E (SSC338Q i6e, .13) showed the feature never did its
advertised job: as a bandwidth throttle it is inert — a `frameLostThreshold`
set to ⅛ of the CBR target dropped **zero** frames over 10 s of steady
streaming — and the `E_MI_VENC_FRMLOST_PSKIP` placeholder-frame variant is
rejected by the driver with `E_MI_ERR_NOT_SUPPORT` (declared in the SDK header
but unimplemented in `libmi_venc`).  In practice it only acted as an I-frame
overshoot guard, a role the CBR rate controller already fills.  The real
backpressure levers are `video0.bitrate` (smooth, quality) and `video0.fps`
(coarse, temporal — a genuine frame-skip via VPE→VENC bind decimation).

- Drop `video0.frameLost` (`frame_lost`) from `VencConfig`, the API field
  table, aliases, defaults, JSON load/render/serialize, and both default
  configs.
- Remove `star6e_controls_apply_frame_lost_threshold`,
  `pipeline_common_frame_lost_threshold`, the boot/dual frame-lost blocks in
  both pipelines, and the `frame_lost` params threaded through
  `*_pipeline_start_dual` / `venc_api_dual_register`.
- Remove the `MI_VENC_{Set,Get}FrameLostStrategy` bindings, macros, and
  `MI_VENC_ParamFrameLost_t`/`MI_VENC_FrameLostMode_e` decls from the star6e
  and maruko SDK shims.
- Contract `0.10.1` → `0.11.0` (breaking: field removed); in-binary
  `/api/v1/version` bumped to match.
- Supersedes the abandoned PR #153 (which had tried to expose the PSKIP mode
  and make the strategy live-tunable).

## [0.18.1] - 2026-06-24

Expose the mDNS `discovery` config section through the HTTP API and WebUI. The
fields shipped in 0.18.0 (`discovery.enabled`, `discovery.serviceType`,
`discovery.name`, `discovery.bareAlias`) were wired into the config
loader/serializer but never registered in the API field table, so they were
reachable only by hand-editing `/etc/waybeam.json` — invisible to
`/api/v1/set`, `/api/v1/capabilities`, and the dashboard.

- Register the four discovery fields in `g_fields[]` (all `restart_required`:
  the beacon reads config at boot / re-reads on SIGHUP-respawn, with no live
  re-announce path), plus camelCase aliases for `serviceType`/`bareAlias`.
- Add a **Discovery** section to the WebUI settings, with per-field tooltips
  (`web/dashboard.html`; `src/venc_webui.c` regenerated).

No protocol or beacon behavior change — purely makes the existing discovery
config settable at runtime and visible to operators.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-16

Add an mDNS device beacon (discovery migration, Phase 1). waybeam_venc now
announces itself as a `_waybeam-venc._tcp.local` service on the multicast
group 224.0.0.251:5353, so ground stations and Android clients can discover
the encoder directly — independent of the optional waybeam-hub, which is the
only thing that previously advertised the vehicle.

**Announce-only, self-contained, off the hot path.** The beacon runs on its
own thread (`src/mdns_beacon.c`), started from `main()` and torn down (with a
multicast goodbye) before any SIGHUP-respawn exec. It responds to PTR queries
for its own service type and re-announces periodically; it does **not**
discover peers or feed any trust layer. The RFC 6762/6763 wire codec lives in
`src/mdns_wire.c` (`MDNS_WIRE_VERSION 1`) — the source of truth that
waybeam-hub will vendor; keep both in sync. The wire codec and multicast
socket handling are derived from
[OpenIPC herald](https://github.com/OpenIPC/firmware/tree/master/general/package/herald)
(MIT), the compact mDNS/DNS-SD stack for the OpenIPC project.

TXT is kept **deliberately minimal**: the service type `_waybeam-venc._tcp`
is itself the recognition signal ("an OpenIPC camera running the waybeam
encoder"), so TXT carries only `proto` (wire-schema version) and `version`
(waybeam version). The hostname/IP/port travel in the standard SRV/A/instance
records; live state (bitrate/fps/mode) is never advertised. The sidecar port,
backend/SoC, codec, full serial, and hub presence are left for the consumer to
fetch with one `GET /api/v1/config` after discovery — the beacon announces an
always-true device fact, capabilities are queried on demand.

**Serial-suffix naming.** The instance/host name is `waybeam-<suffix>.local`,
where `<suffix>` is the tail of the SigmaStar SoC **die ID** read natively
from RIU registers via `/dev/mem` (`src/device_id.c`, method lifted from
OpenIPC `ipctool` and device-verified against `ipcinfo -i`). This gives every
Star6E a stable, collision-free name with no RFC 6762 rename churn. SoCs with
no die ID (ssc37x / Maruko, verified) fall back to `discovery.name` or bare
`waybeam`. The full 12-hex die ID is the fleet key, exposed read-only at
`GET /api/v1/config` → `data.device.serial`.

**Bare `waybeam.local` alias.** Because most setups run a single vehicle, the
beacon also claims the bare host name `waybeam.local` (config
`discovery.bareAlias`, default true) so it can be reached as
`http://waybeam.local` without the suffix. It publishes A records for both
names and answers `A` queries for either. If a second waybeam device contests
`waybeam.local`, the conflict is resolved on the existing RX socket by an
RFC 6762 §8.2 IP tiebreak (higher IP keeps it; the lower IP yields with a
goodbye and keeps only its unique suffixed name) — no flapping, every device
still reachable by `waybeam-<suffix>.local`.

New `discovery` config section (`enabled` default true, `serviceType`,
`name`, `bareAlias`). The beacon is inert when disabled, when no usable
interface exists, or if the socket can't bind — it never blocks the encode
path.

Design: `documentation/DISCOVERY_TRUST_MIGRATION_SPEC.md`.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-06-13

Fix dual-record mode never engaging under runtime control — the SD-card
recording bitrate is now independent of the live stream bitrate, as documented.

**Dual-VENC channel creation is gated on `record.mode`, not `record.enabled`.**
Previously the secondary (ch1) record channel was created at pipeline init only
when `record.enabled` was true. A runtime-control client (e.g. RubyFPV) that
sets `record.enabled=false` and starts recording later via
`/api/v1/record/start` never got the ch1 channel: the record path fell back to
mirror mode and captured ch0 (the `video0` stream bitrate, typically ~5–12 Mbps
adaptive) instead of ch1 (`record.bitrate`, e.g. 40 Mbps). Recordings silently
tracked the link bitrate and the documented "stream low / record high" dual mode
was unreachable outside the auto-start-at-boot path.

The channel topology now follows `record.mode` alone; `record.enabled` still
controls only whether recording auto-starts at boot. The ch1 TS writer already
no-ops while the recorder is closed, so an idle ch1 (mode=dual, not yet
recording) writes nothing until `/api/v1/record/start` opens the file. Star6E
only (Maruko has no TS recording).

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-12

Dropped HEVC RTP Aggregation Packets (AP, NAL type 48) entirely — the wire
output is now single-NAL + FU-A only, on both backends.

**Why.** AP is valid RFC 7798, but it bought waybeam almost nothing in the
FPV profile and actively hurt resilience. In single-slice H.265 the picture
is one large VCL NAL that goes out as FU-A regardless; the only NALs small
enough to aggregate were the VPS/SPS/PPS triplet on each IDR. Bundling those
three into one packet means a single lost datagram takes out the entire
parameter set and renders the whole GOP undecodable — the worst thing to
aggregate on a lossy RF link. It also broke receivers that only implement
the universally-supported single-NAL + FU-A subset (e.g. majestic-tuned RTP
depacketizers), which forwarded the type-48 packets as corrupt video. The
benefit was ~2 fewer packets per keyframe; the cost was interop failures and
reduced loss tolerance. Net negative for this use case, so it's gone rather
than gated behind a config flag.

**What changed.**
- `hevc_rtp` no longer has an `HevcApBuilder`. `hevc_rtp_send_nal()` and
  `hevc_rtp_prepend_param_sets()` drop their aggregation-builder argument;
  each NAL is emitted immediately as a single-NAL packet or FU-A fragments.
  VPS/SPS/PPS are now prepended as separate packets on IDR (majestic-style).
- `HevcRtpStats` loses `ap_packets` / `ap_nals`; the `[pktzr]` verbose line
  is now `nals N | rtp N | fill N B | single N | fu N` on both backends.
- `h26x_util_hevc_get_layer_id()` / `h26x_util_hevc_get_tid_plus1()` removed —
  their only consumer was the deleted AP-header builder.
- `test_hevc_rtp` and `test_star6e_hevc_rtp` rewritten to assert that **no
  type-48 packet is ever emitted** (VPS+SPS+PPS+IDR now arrive as four
  separate datagrams), plus the existing single/FU-A/marker-bit coverage.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-06

Sensor-level image orientation — `image.flip` and `image.mirror` now work
correctly on both backends.

**`image.flip` / `image.mirror` are applied at the sensor, once at bring-up.**
Previously orientation rode the VPE digital flip (`MI_VPE_SetChannelParam`
`mirror`/`flip`), which is unreliable on several sensor combos — on IMX335
(Star6E) `flip` stalled the encoder outright. Orientation now programs the
sensor's own register via `MI_SNR_SetOrien`, applied **once** at bring-up
(`sensor_select` before `MI_SNR_Enable`, and `start_vpe`/`maruko_start_vpe`
before the VPE channel starts); the VPE digital flip stays disabled. The
sensor driver only rewrites orientation when we set it, so a single apply
holds for the life of the stream — device-verified on IMX335 (Star6E) and
IMX415 (Maruko), `flip` + `mirror` both correct and stable.

A one-shot re-apply follows the discrete `MI_SNR_SetFps` events that can
reprogram sensor timing (Star6E live ISP-bin reload; Maruko cold-boot fps
kick). There is **no** per-frame re-apply loop and **no** use of
`MI_SNR_GetOrien` (it reads stale values under AE I2C load on IMX335).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-06

Unified stabilization control law — `stab` and `stab-fill` now behave
identically, and the feel knobs were replaced with the Kalman Q/R.

**`stab` adopts the `stab-fill` Kalman trajectory smoother.**  Previously the two
presets ran different control laws — `stab` used an EMA + gated return-to-centre
(driven by `stabSmoothPct`/`StillFrames`/`EdgePct`/`MotionThresh`), `stab-fill`
used a Kalman trajectory filter — so identical settings produced different
return-to-centre behaviour.  The detector now runs ONE law (the Kalman) for both;
the only per-preset difference is the emit step (HW crop reprogram vs software
compose).  Same settings → same feel.

**Feel knobs replaced by the Kalman tuning.**  The four inert-after-unification
knobs (`stabSmoothPct`, `stabStillFrames`, `stabEdgePct`, `stabMotionThresh`)
were removed and replaced with the two knobs the Kalman law actually exposes,
shared by both presets:
- `stabKalmanQ` (FT_DOUBLE, default 0.03, range `0.001..1.0`) — pan response
  (process noise): higher = follows pans sooner / weaker hold.
- `stabKalmanR` (FT_DOUBLE, default 2.0, range `0.1..50.0`) — smoothness
  (measurement noise): higher = smoother but laggier.

`stabRecenterSpeed` is retained but now only sets the `pauseStab` glide-home
rate (the Kalman recentres during normal operation).  Schema migration is
graceful: old `stab*` keys in a saved config are ignored on load; absent
`stabKalman*` keys take the preset defaults.  Both new fields render in the
data-driven Stabilization WebUI section.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-06

Live stab pause for the HW-crop `stab` preset + a fully data-driven
**Stabilization** WebUI section.

**`pauseStab` now works on `framing=stab`, not just `stab-fill`.**  The D13
software-ramp pause was previously gated to the fill path (its `set_live` hook
was wired only on the `stab-fill` module; toggling it under `framing=stab`
returned `-1` → a WebUI error toast).  The pause branch is now mode-agnostic in
the detector: when paused it undoes the tick's measurement and decays the
trajectory toward centre, so HW-crop glides the crop window home (via the smooth
low-pass → `apply_port_crop`) and fill glides the floating image home — same
software ramp, no HW rebind on either.  `set_live` is wired on both stab
vtables; `star6e_stab_set_paused` now guards on `g_stab_running` (any stab
detector) instead of `g_stab_fill_mode`.

**Stabilization section is now data-driven.**  The six persisted stab knobs
(`stabCropPct`, `stabRecenterSpeed`, `stabSmoothPct`, `stabStillFrames`,
`stabEdgePct`, `stabMotionThresh`) carry `FIELD_UI` metadata and were removed
from the static Video section; together with the runtime-only `pauseStab` they
render as one collapsible **Stabilization** group from `/api/v1/capabilities`
— no per-field `dashboard.html` edit or webui-blob rebuild.  The four advanced
feel knobs (smooth/still/edge/motion), previously API-only, now have WebUI
controls.  Ranges mirror the API validators; `0 = preset default` where noted.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-06

Framing-module refactor + the `stab-fill` floating-image stabilization preset
(PR #136 reworked onto master), plus a data-driven field schema so module
fields reach the WebUI without a dashboard rebuild.

**Stabilization is now a registered `FramingModule` (Star6E).**  All `stab`
code moved out of `star6e_pipeline.c` into `src/star6e_framing_stab.c` behind a
`FramingModule` vtable, gated by a `STAB` build flag (default 1; `make build
STAB=0` excludes the module entirely — no stab code linked, `framing` falls to
`off`).  The legacy single-thread manual-drain fallback is gone; on port1-tap
failure the HW-crop path degrades to a bound static centre crop.  Behavior of
`framing="stab"` is unchanged (bench-verified on imx335).

**New preset `framing="stab-fill"` — floating image on a black border.**  A
second registered module sharing the IVE detector/geometry/Kalman with `stab`.
Instead of HW-cropping, it SCL-downscales the full sensor frame to the encode
size (no shrink) and the manual-drain compose shifts a window inside it,
black-filling the exposed edge (`BufFillPa` strips + `BufBlitPa` content) on a
threaded blit worker decoupled from IVE via a 2-slot ring.  `stabCropPct` sets
the max shift / black-border budget.  A Kalman trajectory smoother (folded
preset constants) replaces the `stab` EMA.  Device-verified 60 fps on imx335.

**Live `video0.pauseStab` (stab-fill only).**  Software ramp: glides the
applied offset back to centre via the recenter decay — no `MI_VENC_StopRecvPic`
/ `BindChnPort2` live rebind (the maneuver that wedged the SoC), no thread
teardown.  `MUT_LIVE`, not persisted; routed module-side through the
`FramingModule` set_live hook.

**`stabCropPct` hardened to [60,100]** for stab presets (API validator floor
50→60, plus load-time + module clamp).  Self-heals a stale `stabCropPct=0`
(saved while `framing=off`, then framing re-set via a string-only edit) that
previously overrode the preset default and silently disabled stabilization.

**Data-driven field schema.**  `FieldDesc` gains an optional `ui` descriptor
(group/label/control/range/options/tooltip); `/api/v1/capabilities` emits a
per-field `ui` block when present, and the dashboard renders those fields
generically — a module field is WebUI-visible with no `dashboard.html` edit or
webui-blob rebuild.  `pauseStab` ships via this path; `stab-fill` added to the
framing dropdown.  Core fields keep the static dashboard schema unchanged.

**OSD note (Star6E).**  The venc debug OSD composites on VPE port0 (pre-stab),
so under stab-fill it rides the content — a known cosmetic limit of this
vehicle-local dev overlay (off by default).  For a screen-fixed OSD on the
stabilized stream use waybeam_hub's `osd_render` (composites at the SCL stage,
post-shift).  The two share the single global `MI_RGN` device and are mutually
exclusive — run one or the other.

**Tooling.**  `tools/build_webui.py` now pins the gzip OS header byte so the
embedded blob is byte-identical regardless of the builder's Python version
(CPython 3.11+ changed it from 0x03 to 0xff), fixing `make webui-check` /
`make verify` on modern Python.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-20

Digital image stabilization (DIS) on the Star6E VPE pipeline, re-grafted
cleanly on top of the 0.11.0 zoom work (#120) rather than the original
stabilization branch (#118), which forked before the pan-ramp/AE-meter
changes landed and could no longer cherry-pick clean.

**Framing mode — one knob for stabilization and zoom.**  A single
`video0.framing` preset is the sole user-facing knob for what the VPE crop
does (resilience-style): `off`, the stabilization presets `low`|`medium`|
`high` (Star6E only), and the digital-zoom presets `zoom-1.25x`|`zoom-1.50x`|
`zoom-1.75x`|`zoom-2x` (both backends).  It expands into the derived
stab crop/recenter or zoom crop fraction — mutually exclusive — and replaces
the old standalone `stab` and continuous `zoomPct` fields, neither of which
is part of the JSON schema or HTTP API anymore.  Zoom presets shrink the
crop + encoded output together (1:1, no SCL upscale; e.g. `zoom-2x` of
1920×1080 → 960×528).  `zoomX`/`zoomY` remain live and pan the crop in every
mode.  `video0.framing` is `MUT_RESTART`.

**Stabilization data path (Star6E).**  Preferred path (HW-crop): VPE port0 hardware-crops the stab
window — `MI_VPE_SetPortCrop` per detection — straight into a VENC **bind**
(zero-copy, no per-frame blit), while a tiny 256×256 port1 tap feeds
`MI_IVE_Shift_Detector` for motion estimation.  Decoupling the detector
from the stream lets ch0 run at full sensor rate (90/120 fps at 1080p
confirmed).  The original single-port manual-drain + `MI_SYS_BufBlitPa`
path is retained as an **automatic fallback** if a BSP rejects the
simultaneous port1.  Binding port0→VENC also fixes the long-standing
teardown wedge (the legacy un-drained full-res port0 queue that wedged
`[vpe0_P0_MAIN]` into D-state on restart).  Return-to-center decays the
offset *vector* in a float accumulator → a straight diagonal back to
center with no per-axis rounding tail.  When enabled the source is clamped
to ≤1920×1080 (preserve aspect) to avoid the high-res fps regression; the
encoded resolution then shrinks to the crop fraction of the (clamped)
source, reported in SPS/PPS.  Only the live ch0 stream is stabilized; JPEG
snapshots and the debug OSD see the unstabilized frame.  Dual recording
(`record.mode` dual/dual-stream) is downgraded to single-channel while
stab is active (both would consume VPE port0) — it records the stabilized
ch0 at its bitrate, with a warning.  `video0.stab` is `MUT_RESTART`.

**Interplay with 0.11.0 zoom.**  Stabilization and zoom are now mutually
exclusive *by construction* — a `framing` preset is either one or the other,
so the old "zoomPct ignored while stab on" warning is gone.  `zoomX`/`zoomY`
are honoured in both modes: under a stab preset they pan the stabilized crop
via `star6e_stab_set_pan()`; under a zoom preset they drive the 0.11.0
pan-ramp path.  `apply_zoom` short-circuits to the stab pan when the stab
thread is running.

**Size-change reboot fixed (cold-init VIF/VPE on respawn).**  A
`video0.size` change crosses a sensor-mode boundary; the fork+exec respawn
keeps `/dev/mi_*` fds open (the PR#117/#120 deadlock fix), so the inherited
VIF/VPE fds pinned the *old* mode and the fresh process wedged
`vpe0_P0_MAIN` re-initing to the new mode.  The runtime now detects a
size change (the only field that changes the sensor mode) and the fd-scrub
additionally closes `/dev/mi_vif` + `/dev/mi_vpe` so they re-init cold —
gated so it never runs on same-mode respawns (resilience/framing), which
stay deadlock-safe.  Device-verified clean in both directions
(1920↔2560) on a non-degraded device; closing those two fds does not
deadlock.  (Heavy back-to-back respawn cycling can still hit the
pre-existing cumulative SoC-state degradation that needs a power cycle —
that is independent of this fix.)

**Cold-boot fps re-kick (legacy AE).**  On a cold boot the init-time
`MI_SNR_SetFps` can fire before the ISP bin's AE settles and leave the
sensor timing register below the configured fps.  The CUS3A path already
re-kicks at frame 15; legacy AE now gets an equivalent one-shot re-kick
~1.5s into the run loop.  The CUS3A frame-15 kick was also decoupled from
the shutter-above-cap gate so it fires reliably.

**AE meter follows the crop in both modes.**  The zoom-aware AE meter
(`MI_ISP_CUS3A_SetAECropSize`) now also tracks the stabilized crop window,
so exposure is metered on the framed view rather than the full sensor —
the only intended runtime difference between the two modes is the pan ramp
(smooth under zoom, direct under stab) plus the stab loop's small per-frame
correction.  The SDK emit/readiness/dedup/disable machinery is shared
(`star6e_emit_ae_crop`); the stab window is sized as the crop fraction of
the VPE output (`g_stab_enc / g_stab_src`), not `image_width / precrop` as
the zoom path uses, because stab crops the VPE output rather than precrop.

**Debug OSD under stabilization.**  The OSD attaches at the full source
dim (port0 is never cropped on the stab path) and its stats panel offset
tracks the live crop window per-frame via
`star6e_pipeline_stab_panel_anchor()`, so the panel stays put in the
encoded view as corrections shift the crop.

**IMU-gyro readiness.**  The motion estimate is purely optical today, but
the design leaves a clean seam for gyro fusion: the existing BMI270 driver
now routes its frame-synced samples into a shared `ImuRing` (replacing the
discard stub), and the per-frame estimate lives in
`star6e_stab_estimate_shift()` with `star6e_stab_gyro_window()` supplying
the frame-aligned angular rates for the interval.  Adding gyro-assisted
stabilization is then just the math: integrate yaw/pitch to pixels via the
lens focal length and fuse with the optical shift.  The gyro window is read
and surfaced in the periodic stab diagnostic so the plumbing and
frame-sync are live, not speculative.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-19

Star6E zoom improvements lifted from the DIVP/stabilization branch
work — no DIVP pipeline swap, no stabilization, just two additive
features that make the existing `zoom_pct` + live `zoomX`/`zoomY`
controls feel better — plus a respawn-handler bug fix that makes
the `zoom_pct` MUT_RESTART path safe to use at runtime.

**Pan ramping (hardcoded 150 ms).**  Live pan is now smoothed via
exponential decay: setting `zoomX`/`zoomY` records a *target*, and a
dedicated ramp thread tweens the current crop position toward it
(Star6E ~60 Hz on `MI_VPE_SetPortCrop`, Maruko ~30 Hz on
`MI_SCL_SetPortConfig`).  Time constant is hardcoded — `zoomRampMs`
was briefly a config field but the surface didn't earn its keep.

**Zoom-aware AE meter.**  Whenever zoom is active, the ISP's AE
statistics window (`MI_ISP_CUS3A_SetAECropSize`, 0..1023 normalized)
is constrained to the zoom rect.  Sky-into-the-frame and
bright-light-source-near-edge no longer crush the zoomed subject;
pan across light↔dark regions and exposure follows.  Silent no-op
if the SDK lacks the symbol; gated on CUS3A readiness so the
boot-time WARNING from calling before the ISP channel is up no
longer fires.

**Respawn fd-scrub fix (root cause for SoC hang on MUT_RESTART).**
The `venc_respawn` post-fork fd scrub loop unconditionally closed
every non-stdio file descriptor before `execv`.  On Star6E this
included `/dev/mi_sys` (and other `/dev/mi_*` SDK fds), whose
release handler in the SigmaStar driver hangs uninterruptibly
when called after `MI_SYS_Exit` returned cleanly — which is the
normal state after a zoom_pct (or any MUT_RESTART) reinit.
Userspace hang → watchdog 3s SIGKILL → sysrq-b emergency reboot.

The fix: detect /dev/mi_* targets via readlink and skip closing
them.  Reintroduces the slow 1-fd-per-respawn leak the scrub was
originally written to plug, but bounded by RLIMIT_NOFILE (~1024
respawns) — vastly preferable to wedging the device.  Bench-
validated: 4 back-to-back zoom_pct toggles complete cleanly with
no watchdog escalation.  This fixes a class of bug shared by
zoom_pct, resilience preset, sensor mode, and any other
MUT_RESTART field; resilience and sensor-mode just happened not to
trip it as reliably (their teardown timing left mi_sys in a
slightly different state).

Star6E only.  Maruko `apply_zoom` accepts the new `ramp_ms` argument
for API parity but ignores it; no Maruko pipeline changes.

## [0.10.16] - 2026-05-15

Two new OSD-safe resilience presets for ultra-low recovery latency:

- `rescue` — 0.25 s GOP, no intra-refresh, no SVC-T.  Pure IDR-spam
  fallback.  ~35–40 % of the bitstream is IDR data, but the recovery
  floor is the lowest of any preset (next IDR is never more than
  250 ms away).  Useful as a spec-compliant baseline when
  A/B-debugging whether an intra-refresh preset is misbehaving in
  the field.
- `sprint` — 0.5 s GOP + `fast` (150 ms) intra-refresh, no SVC-T.
  Combines the stripe-recovery of `racing` with a guaranteed IDR
  floor every 500 ms.  ~20–25 % IDR overhead.  Pick over `racing`
  when you have bitrate headroom and want belt-and-suspenders
  recovery on close-range / line-of-sight links.

Both join the OSD-safe column (no green smear).  No code-path
changes — just two new entries in the resilience preset table.

## [0.10.15] - 2026-05-15

Both backends: resilience SETs now persist their new value to
`/etc/waybeam.json` and return `{"reboot_required": true}` rather than
reinitialising the encoder in-place.

Empirically confirmed on Maruko (192.168.2.12) that in-process pipeline
reinit also crashes the SDK kernel module — not always, but reliably
within a small number of transitions.  A controlled 7-transition sweep
on the Feb 22 (pre-gate) binary worked for 6 transitions, then on the
7th (range→fpv) the daemon zombied with a kernel page fault inside
`MI_SYS_IMPL_FlushInputPortTasks` in the `mi` module:

    do_task_dead ← do_exit ← die ← __do_kernel_fault ← do_page_fault
        ← do_DataAbort ← __dabt_svc ← CamOsTimerModify
        ← MI_SYS_IMPL_FlushInputPortTasks [mi]

System stayed alive (ICMP OK) but waybeam process became State=Z and
did not respawn (no init supervisor).  SIGHUP did not recover; reboot
was required.

**Why.**  The SigmaStar VENC SDK does not cleanly release kernel
encoder driver state across live reinit cycles when intra-refresh or
refPred toggles, even with fork+exec respawn and a 500 ms post-exit
settle.  Bench testing (Star6E, 192.168.1.13) reproduced two failure
modes:

- **Cross-group transitions** (refPred on↔off, intra-refresh on↔off)
  crash on the first transition.  The original gate in 0.10.14b
  caught these.
- **In-group transitions** (e.g. `endurance` → `patrol`, both
  `ref_base = 0`, intra-refresh active) succeed once or twice then
  crash.  The second sweep wedged the device after racing → endurance
  (success) → patrol (SoC panic, ICMP dies, power cycle required).
  No combination of settle delay or partial state reset prevented the
  cumulative kernel state corruption.

Cold-boot into any preset is 100 % reliable.  Shipping the reboot
model is the conservative, no-surprises choice — users edit config or
issue a SET, the daemon writes the change, the user reboots, and the
new preset takes effect.

**Implementation.**

- `src/venc_api.c`: extended the `resilience_change` detector in
  `process_restart_set_query()` to fire on changes to any of
  `resilience`, `intra_refresh_mode/lines/qp`, or
  `ref_base/enhance/pred`.  When a change matches, the new config is
  persisted to disk, `venc_api_request_reinit()` is **not** called,
  and the response carries `reboot_required: true`.  `gop_size` is
  intentionally NOT gated — it has always been live-changeable as a
  plain MUT_RESTART field and preset switches are caught by the
  `resilience` name change already.
- README documents the reboot-required behaviour next to the field
  table.

## [0.10.14] - 2026-05-15

Three new resilience presets — `endurance`, `patrol`, `rally` — and a
revised classification along an OSD-safe / OSD-unsafe axis after
bench-isolating why `range`/`fpv` leave persistent green smear on the
OSD panel.

**Root cause (two layers):**

1. **SVC-T TRAIL_N effective wavefront math.**  The temporal-layering
   rewrite marks `ref_enhance` of every `(ref_enhance + 1)` frames as
   TRAIL_N (display-only, dropped from the decoder's DPB), so the
   effective wavefront in the DPB is
       effective_wavefront_ms = nominal_wavefront_ms × (ref_enhance + 1)
   `range` = 2500 ms and `fpv` = 5000 ms both exceed the 2.0 s GOP,
   so the picture never reaches stripe-only recovery — only an IDR
   completes it.

2. **OSD-specific chroma artefact.**  For static high-contrast overlay
   content (OSD text, near-neutral chroma everywhere), the R-D loop
   picks chroma skip-mode in every MB because chroma residual is
   essentially zero.  Once chroma drifts in a TRAIL_N frame, no
   amount of intra-refresh recovers it — the stripe MBs land in
   display-only frames and never reach the DPB.  Bench-confirmed via
   JPEG snapshot from the same VPE port: the encoder *input* is
   clean (sharp OSD, correct chroma), the H.265 bitstream is what
   produces the green smear.  ROI delta-QP doesn't help because
   skip-mode bypasses QP for zero-residual blocks, and the SigmaStar
   i6c VENC API exposes no force-intra-MB knob.

**Conclusion baked into the preset table:**

Any preset with `ref_enhance > 0` is OSD-unsafe.  The fix is to
classify presets along this axis and let users pick:

| preset      | intra-refresh   | ref_enhance | GOP   | OSD-safe?         | role                                       |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `off`       | off             | 0           | user  | yes (no refresh)  | manual control                              |
| `quality`   | off             | 0           | 4.0 s | yes (IDR-based)   | best image, slow recovery                   |
| `racing`    | fast (150 ms)   | 0           | 2.0 s | yes               | close-range LOS, fast stripe recovery       |
| `endurance` | balanced (500ms)| **0** (was 2) | 2.0 s | yes               | less bitrate on stripes, slower wavefront   |
| `patrol`    | balanced (500ms)| **0** (was 1) | 4.0 s | yes               | long stable flight, 4 s GOP for bandwidth   |
| `rally`     | fast (150 ms)   | 1           | 2.0 s | no                | light refPred, motion-heavy scenes (no OSD) |
| `range`     | balanced (500ms)| 4           | 2.0 s | no                | long-range FPV, heavy refPred (no OSD)      |
| `fpv`       | robust (1000ms) | 4           | 2.0 s | no                | drone FPV, heaviest refPred (no OSD)        |

`endurance` and `patrol` lose their original 1:2 / 1:1 SVC-T pyramid —
they're now racing-class OSD-safe presets distinguished by slower
wavefront (less stripe bitrate) and longer GOP respectively.  `rally`
keeps its 1:1 SVC-T as the lightest refPred option for OSD-off
scenarios.  `range` and `fpv` remain the heavy-refPred presets,
unchanged.

Existing config files that set `resilience=racing`, `range`, or `fpv`
load with identical behaviour.  Users explicitly on `endurance` or
`patrol` from intermediate 0.10.14 dev binaries lose SVC-T but gain
OSD-safe recovery — a behavioural change documented in README.md.

WebUI dashboard enum, API test suite (1588 unit tests), and preset
expansion test cases all updated.  Bench-validated on Star6E
192.168.1.13: racing/endurance/patrol clean up the OSD area within
~10 wavefront cycles; rally/range/fpv leave persistent green smear
that only an IDR can clear.

## [0.10.13] - 2026-05-15

Config-surface simplification: drop dormant `sensor.unlock_*` fields
and merge per-backend AE selectors into one knob.

- **`isp.aeEngine` replaces `isp.legacyAe` (Star6E) + `isp.aeMode`
  (Maruko).**  Two values: `"sdk"` (default) — SDK firmware runs AE —
  and `"custom"` — userspace cus3a takes over.  Mapping on load:

  | `aeEngine` | Star6E | Maruko |
  |---|---|---|
  | `"sdk"` (default) | `legacy_ae=true`  | `ae_mode="native"`   |
  | `"custom"`        | `legacy_ae=false` | `ae_mode="throttle"` |

  Parser keeps the per-backend struct fields populated from the
  unified field, so existing call sites in `star6e_runtime.c`,
  `star6e_pipeline.c`, and `maruko_pipeline.c` need no change.
  Unknown values fall back to `"sdk"`.  Migration: existing
  `/etc/waybeam.json` files containing `legacyAe` and/or `aeMode`
  load cleanly — the parser silently drops both keys and the
  `aeEngine` default (`"sdk"`) drives behaviour, which is the same
  as the historical defaults (`legacyAe=true` + `aeMode="native"`).
  Bench-confirmed on 192.168.1.13: setting `legacyAe=false` cycled
  in custom-AE mode (`[cus3a]` supervisory thread + 15 Hz limits
  enforcement) before the unification commit.

- **H.265 dead-branch cleanup follow-up to 0.10.12.**
  `rtp_session_payload_type()` is now an unconditional `97`,
  `maruko_video.c` drops the defensive non-PT_H265 guard, and
  `star6e_scene_is_idr()` drops the codec parameter (always 1 since
  the H.264 retirement).  Three stale H.264/H.265 comments updated.
  Encoder rate-control union branches (`H264CBR`/`H264VBR`/`H264AVBR`
  in `*_controls.c`) remain in place as documented dead code — they
  follow the SDK enum and ripping them out is more churn than it's
  worth.



- **`sensor.unlockEnabled` / `unlockCmd` / `unlockReg` / `unlockValue` /
  `unlockDir` retired from the user surface; unlock now fires
  unconditionally on every cold boot.**  The
  `MI_SNR_CustFunction(pad, cmd=0x23, reg=0x300a, value=0x80, dir=0)`
  hook is required on IMX415 and IMX335 before `MI_SNR_SetRes`/
  `MI_SNR_SetFps(120)` will accept the high-FPS modes — without it
  the SDK returns -1608835041 and the sensor clamps to 30 fps.
  Initial hot-state bench testing on 192.168.1.13 suggested the hook
  was redundant, but a cold reboot proved that was kernel-driver
  sticky state from earlier unlocked frames; the hook is genuinely
  needed.

  Removing the user-facing knob (rather than reverting the
  simplification) keeps the rule out of the config surface where
  flipping it off accidentally would brick high-FPS sensors.

- **Migration:** existing `/etc/waybeam.json` files containing any of
  the five legacy `unlock*` keys load cleanly — the parser silently
  drops them.  Default JSON ships without the keys.  A user config
  with `"unlockEnabled": false` (which used to be valid) is silently
  ignored; the always-on default takes over.

- **Code path preserved.**  `VencConfigSensor::unlock_{enabled,cmd,
  reg,value,dir}` remain in the struct (defaults: enabled=true plus
  the IMX415/IMX335 register values), and `sensor_unlock_strategy()`
  + `MI_SNR_CustFunction` call sites in `star6e_pipeline.c` and
  `maruko_config.c` stay intact.



refPred (SVC-T temporal hierarchical reference) lands as a real feature
behind a single user-facing knob: `video0.resilience`.

- **`video0.resilience` is the sole knob for intra-refresh + SVC-T +
  GOP.**  Five values pick a 2x2 matrix of trade-offs:

  |                          | Low resilience (best image) | High resilience (more overhead) |
  |--------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
  | **Fast recovery needed** | `racing` (intra=fast)       | `fpv` (intra=robust + refPred)  |
  | **Slow recovery OK**     | `quality` (no extras)       | `range` (intra=balanced + refPred) |

  `off` (default) disables both intra-refresh and refPred and honours
  the user's `gopSize`.  Named presets always set `gopSize` (4.0s for
  `quality`, 2.0s for the rest) — the previous "gop=0 means
  intra-refresh picks" auto-mode is gone.  Removed from the user
  surface: `intraRefreshMode`, `intraRefreshLines`, `intraRefreshQp`,
  `refBase`, `refEnhance`, `refPred` (granular fields are still
  populated internally by the preset).

- **refPred (SVC-T) TRAIL_N rewrite.**  The encoder produces a real
  base/enhance pyramid (`MI_VENC_SetRefParam(base=1, enhance=4)` for
  `range`/`fpv`) and the runtime patches NAL byte 0 from `TRAIL_R`
  (type 1) to `TRAIL_N` (type 0) for frames the SDK marked
  `ENHANCE_P_NOTFORREF`.  Without the rewrite the firmware emits every
  NAL as TRAIL_R regardless of its actual eRefType — generic HEVC
  decoders DPB-thrash and visibly warp.  H.265 only.  Mirrored on both
  Star6E (`src/star6e_runtime.c:79-150`) and Maruko
  (`src/maruko_pipeline.c:2904-2965`).

- **`GET /api/v1/resilience/status`** — combined view.  Returns
  `preset`, `intra.{mode,active,mi_supported,apply_ok,effective_lines,
  effective_qp}`, `refPred.{active,mi_supported,apply_ok,base,enhance,
  pred}`, `gop.{effective_sec,auto}`.  GOP value comes from
  `g_cfg->video0.gop_size` (post-preset expansion), so it stays
  accurate even when intra-refresh is off and the existing
  `/api/v1/intra/status` reports zero.

- **Debug OSD: resilience banner.**  When `resilience != "off"`, an
  extra row renders above the existing `intra`/`gop` lines —
  `res fpv rp=1/4` when refPred is active, `res quality` otherwise.

- **Migration:** existing `/etc/waybeam.json` files containing the old
  `intraRefreshMode` / `refBase` / `refEnhance` / `refPred` keys load
  cleanly — the parser ignores them and `resilience` (defaulting to
  `off`) drives behaviour.  Devices upgrading from 0.10.11 keep their
  `gopSize`, `outgoing.server`, and all operational state intact.

- **Bench validation:** Star6E 192.168.1.13 cycled through all five
  presets via REST + restart + log inspection.  Maruko 192.168.2.12
  surgically patched (old granular keys removed, `resilience: "off"`
  added, every other field preserved) and exercised through `quality`,
  `racing`, `range`, `fpv`.  Decoder picture clean at 192.168.2.20 with
  refPred on; OSD garbling on first apply resolves on next IDR (not a
  refPred corruption bug — documented in agent memory).

- **H.265 hardcoded — `video0.codec` retired.**  The video codec is now
  unconditionally HEVC across both backends; the user-facing field is
  gone from the schema, default JSON, and pretty-print/JSON-export.
  This removes the H.264 + refPred footgun (the SVC-T + TRAIL_N rewrite
  is HEVC-only) and collapses several rcMode / RTP / refType branches
  into a single H.265 path.  Migration: existing configs with
  `"codec": "h264"` load cleanly — the key is silently dropped and the
  daemon emits HEVC.  Legacy clients setting `video0.codec=h264` via
  `/api/v1/set` receive a 404 `unknown config field` rather than silent
  acceptance.  Resilience preset table is no longer codec-conditional.

## Investigation - 2026-05-14 — **SOLVED**: IMX415 driver regression is a single missing register write

**Root cause**: `drivers/sensor_imx415_maruko.c` does not write
**`0x3032 = 0x01`** in any of its four init tables.  The stock OpenIPC
`sensor_imx415_mipi.ko` does.  That is the entire dark-image regression.

**Proof**: After a full 0x3000–0x4FFF (8192 reg) i2ctransfer sweep in both
dark-venc and bright-venc states, exactly one register differs:

```
0x3032   dark=0x00   bright=0x01
```

**Smoking-gun experiment**: With venc running on the custom driver
producing a dark image, executed `i2ctransfer -y 1 w3@0x1a 0x30 0x32 0x01`
on the bench at 192.168.2.12.  User confirmed the image **immediately
became bright** on the ground-station receiver.

**Register identity**: `drivers/sensor_imx335_maruko.c:232` documents
`0x3032` as `VMAX` (vertical period — controls frame timing).  On IMX415
the same address appears to also be part of the VMAX/timing block.  The
IMX415 init tables in `drivers/sensor_imx415_maruko.c` set `0x3031` (ADBIT)
and `0x3033` (SYS_MODE) but leave `0x3032` unwritten, so it retains the
sensor's power-on default of `0x00` — which causes the frame-period /
exposure window to be wrong, producing the dark image.

**Workaround the user has confirmed working** (boot stock first, then
custom + venc) works because the stock driver writes `0x3032 = 0x01` and
that value survives the soft reboot.

**Fix applied** (one line per init table, four tables total):

```c
{ 0x3031, 0x00 }, // ADBIT (10bit)
{ 0x3032, 0x01 }, // VMAX MSB — must be 0x01, default 0x00 produces dark image
{ 0x3033, 0x05 }, // SYS_MODE (891Mbps)
```

Applied to all four `Sensor_*_init_table_*[]` arrays in
`drivers/sensor_imx415_maruko.c`.  Rebuilt via
`make drivers-maruko KSRC_MARUKO=<...>`:

- New `sensors/maruko/sensor_imx415_maruko.ko` — md5 `bd582d87...` (was `c236ac34...`)
- 4× `{ 0x3032, 0x01 }` patterns confirmed in the binary

**Followup (IMX335) — resolved 2026-05-14**: user swapped to an IMX335
sensor on the bench and confirmed bright image on firstboot with the
unpatched custom `sensor_imx335_maruko.ko`.  As static analysis
predicted, the IMX415 single-bit bug does not apply to IMX335 —
`0x3032` on IMX335 is genuinely the VMAX high nibble and our driver
already writes it correctly as `0x00` in all 5 init tables.  No action
required.

## Investigation - 2026-05-14 — Maruko firstboot dark image is a custom-driver regression

Manual session on bench 192.168.2.12 narrowed the long-standing "venc on
firstboot is dark, majestic-first warms it up" symptom to a regression in
our **custom-built `sensor_imx{335,415}_maruko.ko` kernel modules** (in
`sensors/maruko/`).

Findings, in order:

- Stock `/rom` driver (25K, md5 `a33cfa52...`) + majestic = bright.
- Custom overlay `_maruko.ko` (167K, md5 `c236ac34...`) + venc = dark.
- Custom overlay `_maruko.ko` + majestic = **also dark** — confirmed by
  the user.  This rules out the original "venc-vs-majestic init"
  hypothesis: the bad actor is the .ko, not the streamer.
- Restoring the stock driver via `rm /overlay/root/lib/modules/.../sensor_imx*_mipi.ko`
  and rebooting brings the image back to normal — overlayfs reveals the
  stock `/rom` copy.

Register deltas (regscan curated 254 entries, banks 0x30–0x40) between
dark-custom and bright-stock states: HMAX (`0x3024/0x3025`), BIN_MODE
(`0x3050/0x3051`), and `0x3090` (IMX415 analog).  The custom .ko leaves
all of these at firstboot defaults; the stock .ko writes them.

Workaround the user has confirmed working:

  stock .ko + majestic → soft reboot → custom .ko + venc → bright

That last step is the surprise: with custom .ko in place, `venc` on a
soft reboot still produces a bright image — yet only **one** scanned
register (`0x3032`: 0x00 → 0x01) survived the reboot from the stock
session.  All five HMAX/BIN_MODE/0x3090 registers reverted to dark-state
values.  So the state that actually distinguishes dark-vs-bright lives
**outside regscan's 254-entry range** — likely 0x4100+ (SHR), 0x5000+
(calibration), 0x6000+ (VOUT/MIPI), or ISP-side state.

See `documentation/MARUKO_FIRSTBOOT_DARK_IMAGE_TEST.md` (Findings
section) for the full table and Phase-2 brute-force-sweep plan.

## [0.10.11] - 2026-05-14

Maruko snapshot follow-up: SIGHUP reinit hardening, MJPG quality
actually applied, live-update `snapshot.quality`, and the
Maruko-specific default config finally reaches the release tarball.

- **`snapshot.quality` is MUT_LIVE.**  POST/GET `/api/v1/set?snapshot.quality=N`
  applies instantly with no pipeline reinit — Get→modify→Set on
  `MI_VENC_ChnAttr_t.rate.mjpgQp.quality` on the parked MJPG channel.
  Frontend (`src/venc_jpeg.c`) serializes the live-set call under the
  same module mutex as `venc_jpeg_capture`, so an in-flight snapshot
  request cannot race the SDK Get/Set sequence.  Backend hooks added:
  `venc_jpeg_backend_set_quality(uint32_t)` in both `star6e_jpeg.c`
  and `maruko_jpeg.c`; weak `-ENOSYS` fallback in the common layer
  keeps the host-test build link-clean.  Schema field flips from
  `MUT_RESTART` to `MUT_LIVE` in `g_fields[]`; full LIVE-group wiring
  through `venc_api.c` (key→group, name, supported, copy, apply) +
  `apply_snapshot_quality` callback on `VencApplyCallbacks`.
  Range validator: `[1, 99]` (SDK ceiling) at `validate_field_cfg`.
  Front-end `venc_jpeg_init` clamp aligned to ≤99 (was 100) for
  symmetric behaviour with live-set.
  - Bench (Maruko 192.168.2.12 firstboot): q=20→118 KB, q=50→257 KB,
    q=80→464 KB, q=99→2.03 MB across same pid, zero reinits.
  - Bench (Star6E 192.168.1.13): q=20→51 KB, q=50→78 KB, q=80→154 KB,
    q=99→261 KB across same pid, reinit count unchanged.

- **MJPG quality actually wires through on Maruko** (was silently
  ignored in 0.10.10).  Root cause: `attr.rate.mode` was set to
  `I6C_VENC_RATEMODE_MJPGQP` (= 8), which Maruko firmware interprets
  as `MJPEGVBR` in its UBR-shifted enum — the channel built fine but
  `attr.rate.mjpgQp.quality` was discarded since VBR mode has no
  quality field.  Fixed by adding `MARUKO_VENC_RC_MJPG_{CBR,VBR,FIXQP}`
  = {7,8,9} to `include/maruko_bindings.h` (the firmware-accepted enum
  values, distinct from the I6C SDK header's shifted layout) and
  pointing `maruko_jpeg.c` at `MARUKO_VENC_RC_MJPG_FIXQP` (= 9).
  DQT tables now scale correctly: q=99 → all-1's quantization,
  q=20 → coarse quantization, byte sizes track expected.

- **Maruko SIGHUP reinit no longer crashes on consecutive `kill -1`.**
  Root cause: `maruko_load_isp_bin` calls
  `MI_ISP_DisableUserspace3A` + post-load `CUS3A_Enable` hooks that
  are "once per process lifetime" — re-entering them on the second
  reinit segfaults inside the SDK with `Mutex is not initialized
  before lock` from `libcam_os_wrapper.so`.  Fixed by splitting the
  load path: cold boot keeps the full `maruko_load_isp_bin`; reinit
  uses a new minimal variant that skips both CUS3A hooks (sufficient
  because the kernel ISP module's state survives the in-process
  teardown).  10 consecutive `killall -1 venc` cycles verified clean
  on 192.168.2.12; pid 1894 stable, no SDK reset, no zombie state.

- **Maruko default config reaches the release tarball.**  Two-part
  fix.  First, `config/venc.default.maruko.json` gains the `snapshot`
  block (was missing entirely — Maruko users had snapshot disabled
  until they hand-edited the JSON, even though the schema and runtime
  defaults were already in place).  Second, `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  was copying `config/venc.default.json` for *both* backends when
  staging the release archives, so the Maruko tarball's bundled
  `venc.json` carried Star6E defaults (`sensor.unlockEnabled=true`,
  no `snapshot` block).  Now picks the Maruko-specific template when
  staging `venc-maruko.tar.gz`, falls back to the shared default for
  Star6E.  Firstboot Maruko devices installed from the release tarball
  now ship with `snapshot.enabled=true` and the right unlock policy.

- **Firstboot deployment verified end-to-end on Maruko.**  Wiped
  device (no `/usr/bin/venc`, no `/usr/lib/libmi_*.so`, no
  `/etc/venc.json`); pushed binary + 14 MI libs + 10 sensor `.ko` +
  3 ISP `.bin` + `json_cli` + the bundled `venc.json` in a single
  bulk-push via `scripts/maruko_direct_deploy.sh full
  --push-config config/venc.default.maruko.json`; rebooted; venc
  came up clean at pid 720, IMX335 sensor module loaded, pipeline
  configured at 1920×1080@60, `/api/v1/snapshot.jpg` worked first
  request without manual config edits.

## [0.10.10] - 2026-05-14

Maruko snapshot backend — closes the deferred follow-up from 0.10.9.
`GET /api/v1/snapshot.jpg` now serves a real JPEG on Maruko (was
`503 snapshot_disabled` in 0.10.9).  Star6E unchanged.

- **Architecture** — dedicated MJPG VENC device 8 (`I6C_VENC_DEV_MJPG_0`)
  channel 0, bound to a second SCL output port (SCL dev 0 chn 0 port 1)
  via `MI_SYS_BindChnPort2` in `I6_SYS_LINK_FRAMEBASE` mode at 5 fps
  destination rate.  Channel stays parked (`StopRecvPic`) between
  requests; capture flips `StartRecvPic` on, polls `Query` for ready
  packs, drains via `GetStream`, then parks again.  Same idle pattern
  as Star6E (`src/star6e_jpeg.c`) — no encoder CPU when no snapshot
  is in flight.
- **Why a second SCL port** — Maruko's SCL output port 0 is held by
  the main H.265 channel in `LINK_RING` mode (1:1, `0xA0092012` if
  re-bound).  Port 1 is a fresh tap from the same SCL channel, so
  no contention with the main stream.  Avoids the kthread-leak path
  the earlier HW_RING fan-out attempt hit — `dev 8` only sees SCL,
  never has any relationship to main `dev 0`, so failed-init teardown
  is clean (no `[venc8_P0_MAIN]` orphan).
- **Pipeline wiring** — `src/maruko_pipeline.c::configure_maruko_scl()`
  configures + enables SCL port 1 (YUV420SP, no IFC compress, same
  crop + output dims as port 0).  `bind_maruko_pipeline()` calls
  `venc_jpeg_set_source(&ctx->scl_port1)` before `venc_jpeg_init`.
  `maruko_pipeline_teardown_graph()` disables port 1 after
  `venc_jpeg_shutdown()`.  Port-1 setup failures are non-fatal:
  warning logged, snapshot returns `503` cleanly via the
  `g_have_scl_port=0` path in `venc_jpeg_backend_init`.
- **Bench verification (192.168.2.12, IMX415, 1920×1080@60)** — 10
  rapid snapshots in 679 ms (~14 req/s sustained, all `HTTP 200`);
  size 120–184 KB; mean Y ≈ 124 (bright, post-firstboot-fix); main
  RTP stream to 192.168.2.20 unaffected during snapshot bursts; no
  `[venc8_P0_MAIN]` kthread in `ps`.

Snapshot config schema fields are now part of the on-disk JSON,
fully wired through the standard 7-touch-point machinery:

- **`venc.json` → `snapshot.{enabled,quality,channel,width,height}`**
  with sensible defaults (`enabled=true`, `quality=80`, `channel=7`,
  `width=0`/`height=0` = inherit main stream).  Read on pipeline init
  via `MarukoBackendConfig::snapshot` (Maruko) and `VencConfig::snapshot`
  directly (Star6E).
- `/api/v1/get?snapshot.<field>` and `/api/v1/set?snapshot.<field>=<v>`
  resolve through `g_fields[]` (all MUT_RESTART since the SDK channel
  attrs are baked at `CreateChn` time).
- `config/venc.default.json`, `pretty_print`, `cJSON` serializer, and
  `MarukoBackendConfig` mirror all carry the new section — the
  `layout_size_equal` round-trip test in `tests/test_venc_config.c`
  protects against future drift.

Star6E hardware bench validation is still deferred (no Star6E bench
currently online).

Caveat (pre-existing, not introduced here): rapid back-to-back
`/api/v1/set?<MUT_RESTART_field>=...` requests within the reinit
window can crash venc — same SIGHUP reinit race already tracked in
`roadmaps/waybeam_venc.md` ("SIGHUP reinit stabilization — partial
teardown works, ISP race outstanding").  A single quality / dims
change settles cleanly; users should wait for `reinit_pending=true`
to resolve before issuing another restart-tier `set`.

## [0.10.9] - 2026-05-14

JPEG snapshot HTTP endpoint on both backends.

- **`GET /api/v1/snapshot.jpg`** — dedicated MJPEG VENC channel taps
  the same VPE/SCL output port the main H.264/H.265 stream consumes.
  Channel is created at pipeline-start, kept idle (StartRecvPic off)
  between requests; each request flips StartRecvPic on, polls Query
  for a ready pack, drains one JPEG frame via GetStream, then turns
  StartRecvPic back off.  Captures are serialized through a module
  mutex so concurrent HTTP clients queue rather than collide.
  Response is `Content-Type: image/jpeg`; failure modes are
  `503 snapshot_disabled` (subsystem not initialised),
  `504 snapshot_timeout` (no frame within 1.5 s), or
  `500 snapshot_failed` (SDK / alloc error).  Default quality 80.
- **Star6E backend** (`src/star6e_jpeg.c`) — `I6_VENC_CODEC_MJPG` on
  ch7, `I6_SYS_LINK_FRAMEBASE` bind to the pipeline's VPE port.
  Star6E supports 1:N from a VPE output port, so the snapshot channel
  binds alongside the main H.265 channel without contention.
- **Maruko backend** (`src/maruko_jpeg.c`) — **deferred**.  Bench
  investigation on 192.168.2.12 found two blockers:
  (a) the Maruko SCL output port is 1:1 — binding it to the MJPG
  channel after the main H.265 channel already holds it returns
  `0xA0092012` ("SYS busy", same code documented in `maruko_pipeline.c`
  line 2097 for the dual-stream path);
  (b) an attempted workaround using cross-device VENC HW_RING fan-out
  hit the SDK's teardown bug — failed init left an orphaned
  `[venc8_P0_MAIN]` kernel thread that blocked the next `MI_SYS_Init`
  indefinitely (HISTORY "venc_teardown_regression" pattern; recovered
  via sysrq-b).  Two viable paths forward (out of scope for this PR):
  configure a second SCL output port at pipeline init, or probe the
  cross-device VENC bind before `CreateChn` so failure paths don't
  leak kernel state.  Until then `src/maruko_jpeg.c` is a clean
  `-ENOSYS` stub so `/api/v1/snapshot.jpg` serves 503 cleanly without
  ever touching the SDK.
- **HTTP plumbing** — new `httpd_send_binary()` helper in
  `include/venc_httpd.h` for raw byte payloads with caller-supplied
  `Content-Type`.  Used by the snapshot handler; reusable for any
  future binary endpoint (PNG OSD overlay, IQ blob dumps, etc.).
- **Tests** — `tests/test_venc_jpeg.c` (13 assertions): pre-init
  capture refusal, NULL-arg rejection, `enabled=false` no-op init,
  failed-backend → clean -ENODEV degradation, idempotent shutdown,
  re-init after shutdown.  All run on the host test_runner because
  the common layer's weak-symbol backend stubs make the module
  exercisable without an SDK present.
- **Pipeline lifecycle** — pipeline init calls
  `venc_jpeg_set_source(vpe_port)` + `venc_jpeg_init(&cfg)` right
  after the main VPE/SCL→VENC bind; pipeline teardown calls
  `venc_jpeg_shutdown()` before the matching unbind (idempotent).
  Failure of the snapshot init is non-fatal — the main stream still
  comes up, the snapshot endpoint just serves 503.

Defaults are hardcoded for this release: `quality=80`, `channel=7`
(mapped to ch 0 on Maruko's MJPG_DEV), width/height inherited from
the main stream.  A future release will surface `snapshot.{enabled,
quality,width,height,channel}` in `venc.json`.

## [0.10.8] - 2026-05-14

Release tarball completeness — fixed three gaps that left a fresh
device install incomplete after extracting `venc-maruko.tar.gz`:

- **Sensor drivers shipped (Maruko).**  `sensors/maruko/sensor_imx{335,415}_maruko.ko`
  are now vendored in the repo (source-built via `make drivers-maruko`,
  ~320 KB total).  `make stage SOC_BUILD=maruko` renames them to
  `_mipi.ko` for drop-in compatibility with stock OpenIPC kernel
  module naming, and the release tarball ships them under
  `drivers/`.  Previously the release was sensor-driver-free, so a
  fresh-device install ended up running stock OpenIPC drivers
  regardless of the modifications in `drivers/sensor_*.c`.  See
  `sensors/maruko/README.md` for provenance.
- **ISP tuning blobs shipped (Maruko).**  `iq-profiles/maruko-bin/imx{335,415,415_fpv_api}.bin`
  are now vendored (~420 KB total), pulled from the verified bench
  at 192.168.2.12.  Release tarball ships them under `isp-bins/` so
  fresh devices have IQ tuning available without a manual
  `/etc/sensors/` pull.  See `iq-profiles/maruko-bin/README.md`.
- **regscan shipped (both backends).**  IMX335/IMX415 i2c register
  dumper (vendored from `tipoman9/star6c_sensor`) now builds in CI
  for both Star6E and Maruko and ships in both tarballs.  Read-only
  diagnostic; used by `scripts/maruko_sensor_init_diff.sh` for
  sensor-init investigations.

CI verification step now hard-checks the new artifacts exist before
upload, so a regression that drops them from the tarball will fail
the build instead of silently shipping an incomplete release.

Release-notes install snippet expanded to cover the new payloads
(`cp drivers/*.ko /lib/modules/.../sigmastar/`, `cp isp-bins/*.bin
/etc/sensors/`, `cp regscan /usr/bin/regscan`).

## [0.10.7] - 2026-05-11

Maruko deploy pipeline polish — fix four PR-review gaps and one
build-cycle ergonomics issue surfaced during bench testing.

- **Per-source object files + `-MMD -MP` dep tracking.**  The
  top-level Makefile used a single monolithic CC invocation that
  compiled and linked all 47 source files in one shot, so every
  iteration of `make build SOC_BUILD=maruko` rebuilt everything from
  scratch even for a one-line edit.  Split into `$(OBJ_DIR)/%.o`
  pattern rules with auto-generated `.d` dep files.  Cold build
  unchanged at ~3.3 s; touching one `.c` is now ~0.13 s (1 compile +
  relink); a header change only rebuilds dependent objects.
- **`push-drivers` no longer non-deterministic.**  When
  `sensors/maruko/` contains both a source-built `sensor_imxNNN_maruko.ko`
  (renamed to `_mipi.ko` on push) and a pulled-from-device blob
  `sensor_imxNNN_mipi.ko`, the alphabetical glob ordering let the
  pulled blob clobber the source-built rename.  `push_drivers` now
  skips the pulled `_mipi.ko` when a `_maruko.ko` sibling exists, and
  logs the skip count.
- **uClibc compat symlinks pushed automatically.**  Stock OpenIPC
  musl firmware ships `/lib/libc.so` only, but the vendor blob
  `libcam_os_wrapper.so` has hardcoded NEEDED tags `ld-uClibc.so.1`
  and `libc.so.0` in its `.dynamic` section (cannot be relinked — it
  is a binary drop).  `push-libs` (and `cycle`/`full` when libs are
  requested) now creates `ln -sf libc.so /lib/ld-uClibc.so.1` and
  `ln -sf libc.so /lib/libc.so.0` after the library push.  Idempotent;
  pristine firstboot devices no longer segfault on first `venc`
  start.  `vendor-libs/maruko/README.md` updated — the previous claim
  that `ld-uClibc.so.1` was "dead since v0.7.0" was wrong (only the
  shim binary is dead; the NEEDED tag inside the wrapper is not).
- **`json_cli` vendored from `waybeam-hub`.**  `scripts/maruko_direct_deploy.sh`'s
  `config-get` / `config-set` / `status` paths all require
  `/usr/bin/json_cli` on the target.  Previously the deploy script
  assumed someone else had pushed it, which broke on firstboot.  Now
  `tools/json_cli/{json_cli.c,jsmn.h}` ship in the repo (re-synced
  from `../waybeam-hub/tools/`); `make json_cli SOC_BUILD=maruko`
  builds `out/maruko/json_cli`; `scripts/maruko_direct_deploy.sh
  push-json-cli` (and `cycle --with-json-cli` / `full`) installs it
  to `/usr/bin/json_cli`.

## [0.10.6] - 2026-05-07

`isp.sensor_bin` is now a live mutable field on both backends.

Previously, swapping the ISP tuning bin via `/api/v1/set?isp.sensorBin=...`
fell into the `MUT_RESTART` path, which on Star6E means `g_running=0` →
clean teardown → fork+exec a successor venc → MI_SYS_Init → reselect sensor
→ rebuild VIF/VPE/VENC.  End-to-end downtime measured ~15 s on the
192.168.1.13 bench — far longer than the ~80 ms the actual
`MI_ISP_*CmdLoadBinFile` call needs.  The fork+exec path is the right call
for sensor mode / size / codec changes (in-process MI_SYS_Init is broken on
Star6E), but it is overkill for an ISP IQ refresh that does not touch the
graph at all.

- New `apply_isp_bin(const char *path)` callback on `VencApplyCallbacks`.
- `FIELD(isp, sensor_bin, ..., MUT_LIVE)` plus a `LIVE_GROUP_ISP_BIN`
  dispatch entry, so single-set and multi-set go through the same live
  apply path that already drives bitrate / fps / awb_mode.
- Star6E (`star6e_pipeline_load_isp_bin_live`):
  resolve via `pipeline_common_resolve_isp_bin` (configured path → sensor
  fallback → none), short-circuit when the resolved path matches the
  last-loaded one, otherwise call the existing `*_load_isp_bin` path.
  Reapplies `MI_ISP_AE_SetExposureLimit` (bin can reset AE limits) and,
  in `legacyAe` mode, kicks `MI_SNR_SetFps` so the sensor's physical
  shutter register isn't left at the bin's cold-boot value — without
  this, swapping to a darker bin locks the sensor at ~12 fps until reinit
  (cold_boot_fps_lock).
- Maruko (`maruko_pipeline_load_isp_bin_live`): same resolve+dedup
  shape, but uses a stripped-down `maruko_load_isp_bin_minimal` that
  intentionally **skips** the `MI_ISP_DisableUserspace3A` and post-load
  `MI_ISP_CUS3A_Enable` hooks the cold-boot path uses.  Re-entering
  CUS3A_Enable on the still-active channel trips the same kernel-mutex
  regression noted in `maruko_stop_vpe_channels` ("Skip DestroyChannel
  — kernel ISP retains CUS3A mutex state") and segfaults venc on the
  second swap.  3A_Proc_0 stays running across the load and picks up
  the new IQ tables on its next tick.  `g_last_isp_bin_path` is
  updated so the next reinit-time gate stays consistent, and cleared
  in `maruko_pipeline_teardown_graph` so the SIGHUP in-process reinit
  runs the cold-boot bin load unconditionally (Star6E gets that for
  free via fork+exec).
- New per-field validator: a non-empty `isp.sensor_bin` must point at a
  readable file or the set is rejected with `409 validation_failed`.
  Empty string still opts into the auto-detect fallback.

Verified on 192.168.1.13 (Star6E, imx415, legacyAe):
- 6 back-to-back swaps complete with end-to-end ~250 ms each (≈80 ms
  reload + ssh round-trip), down from ~15 s.
- Streaming holds at 59-60 fps through and after the swap sequence;
  earlier prototype without the SetFps kick locked at 12 fps.
- `/api/v1/set?isp.sensorBin=/no/such/bin` returns
  `{"code":"validation_failed","message":"isp.sensor_bin path is not
  readable"}` with HTTP 409 and leaves config unchanged.
- `/api/v1/set?isp.sensorBin=` (empty) accepted.
- Reloading the same bin twice short-circuits with
  `> ISP bin reload: <path> already loaded, skipping`.

Verified on 192.168.2.12 (Maruko, imx415):
- 5 back-to-back swaps complete cleanly; venc still up after, 3A_Proc_0
  ticks through the load.  End-to-end ~5.2 s/swap (the Maruko SDK's
  `MI_ISP_API_CmdLoadBinFile` itself takes ~5 s on this BSP — visible
  as a ~75 cus3a-tick gap in the log).  Same order of magnitude as the
  in-process reinit it replaces, but no pipeline graph teardown and
  no HTTP hang under load.
- First minimal-hooks prototype that mirrored the cold-boot
  disable/enable hooks crashed with "WARNING: Mutex is not initialized
  before lock" → segfault on the second swap; that prompted the
  cold-boot-vs-live hook split documented above.
- Validator + empty path + idempotent re-set behave identically to
  Star6E.

Two new unit tests cover the live dispatch, the validator, and the 501
fallback when a backend doesn't supply `apply_isp_bin`.

## [0.10.5] - 2026-05-05

Maruko-specific default config template (`config/venc.default.maruko.json`).

The shipped `config/venc.default.json` defaults `sensor.unlockEnabled` to
`true` because that flag is required on Star6E to unlock IMX415/IMX335
high-FPS modes from cold boot (see
`documentation/SENSOR_UNLOCK_IMX415_IMX335.md`).  The unlock command
(`MI_SNR_CustFunction` cmd `0x23`, reg `0x300a`, value `0x80`) targets a
driver internal latch present in the Star6E `sensor_imx*_mipi.ko`
modules.  On Maruko the sensor driver layout is different and that latch
does not exist — the call is at best a no-op + warning, at worst it
prints a confusing failure on every boot.

A new Maruko user starting from `venc.default.json` would inherit the
unlock-on flag and see those warnings even though their pipeline is
fine.  `config/venc.default.maruko.json` is identical to the Star6E
default except for `sensor.unlockEnabled: false`, so packagers and
first-time Maruko users have a clean starting point.  The runtime is
unchanged — `/etc/venc.json` is still the only path the binary reads.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-05-05

`/api/v1/dual/status` reachable on both backends.

Two related issues fixed:

- **Maruko never registered the dual VENC handle with the HTTP API.**
  `maruko_pipeline_start_dual` brought up chn 1, started the drain
  thread, and set `ctx->dual`, but it never called
  `venc_api_dual_register()`.  Result: `/api/v1/dual/status`,
  `/api/v1/dual/set`, and `/api/v1/dual/idr` all returned 404 even
  with `record.mode = "dual"` or `"dual-stream"` — a regression vs.
  Star6E parity claimed in HTTP_API_CONTRACT §"Dual VENC".
  `maruko_pipeline_stop_dual` now mirrors Star6E by calling
  `venc_api_dual_unregister()` before tearing down chn 1.
- **`/api/v1/dual/status` now always returns 200 with `active`.**
  Previously the handler returned 404 with `not_active` when dual
  was disabled, which made the endpoint indistinguishable from a
  routing miss.  Aligned with the `/api/v1/record/status` shape:
  `{"ok":true,"data":{"active":false}}` when off,
  `{"ok":true,"data":{"active":true,"channel":1,"bitrate":...,
  "fps":...,"gop":...}}` when on.  Write endpoints `/dual/set` and
  `/dual/idr` keep the 404+`not_active` semantics — those still need
  a live channel to operate on.
- **`/api/v1/dual/set` is Star6E-only** (returns 501 on Maruko).
  The previous handler dereferenced `MI_VENC_ChnAttr_t` (i.e.
  `i6_venc_chn`), but Maruko's venc library expects `i6c_venc_chn`
  with a different layout — calling it through the wrong typedef
  corrupted the attr struct.  The latent bug went undetected until
  this version because Maruko never registered the dual handle, so
  `/dual/set` always short-circuited to 404 on Maruko before the
  bad call.  `/dual/idr` is single-arg and works on both.

Verified on 192.168.1.13 (Star6E) with `record.mode` in `{off, dual}`
— `/dual/status` returns `active:false` and `active:true` respectively;
`/dual/set?bitrate=8000` and `/dual/idr` both return 200 in dual mode.
Verified on 192.168.2.12 (Maruko) with `record.mode` in `{off,
dual-stream}` — same status shape, `/dual/idr` returns 200, `/dual/set`
returns 501.  `dual` mode (TS file write) was not exercised on Maruko
because `record.dir=/tmp` is tmpfs there and fills RAM under load;
`dual-stream` exercises the same `venc_api_dual_register` path.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-05-05

HTTP dispatch pause/resume across pipeline reinit and teardown.

Closes a long-standing HTTP↔runner thread race: the httpd worker
dereferences SDK handles (VENC/ISP/SCL/VPE channels, audio capture,
output socket) that the runner thread destroys and recreates during
reinit or shutdown.  Symptoms ranged from `MI_*` errors against a
destroyed channel to outright segfaults under heavy WebUI traffic
during a SIGHUP reinit on Star6E, and visible HTTP hangs across the
in-process reinit window on Maruko.

Fix: a single chokepoint at the httpd worker's dispatch call.

- `venc_httpd_pause()` sets a flag and drains the in-flight handler
  (it takes the same mutex the worker holds across `dispatch()`).
  After pause returns, every new request is answered with 503
  immediately, so SDK state is safe to tear down.
- `venc_httpd_resume()` clears the flag.

Call sites:

- `maruko_runtime.c` brackets `teardown_graph` + `reinit_pipeline` with
  `pause` / `resume` (the in-process reinit window).
- `maruko_pipeline.c` pauses before final teardown (no resume — the
  process is exiting).
- `star6e_runtime.c` pauses across the SDK shutdown teardown until
  `venc_httpd_stop()` returns (no resume — fork+exec parent or normal
  exit).

Hardware verification on 192.168.1.13 (Star6E IMX335 @ 60 fps fork+exec
respawn) and 192.168.2.12 (Maruko in-process reinit): under sustained
mixed `apply_*` / `query_*` traffic, the pause window emits fast
sub-4 ms 503s for clients that hit it, no requests hang, no daemon
crashes, and the encoder keeps streaming throughout the Maruko reinit.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-05-05

Maruko: HTTP record control + raw HEVC recording (Star6E parity).

**HTTP record control** — `/api/v1/record/start` and `/stop` previously
returned 501 "HTTP record control not available on this backend" so
the WebUI dashboard record buttons were dead.  The HTTP request
flags are now drained in the chn 0 drain loop, gated by the same
`!ctx->dual` guard that protects the chn 0 write (the dual chn 1
drain thread owns the recorder when active).  Back-to-back `/start`
calls rotate the segment cleanly and request an IDR so the new
segment begins on a keyframe.

**Raw HEVC recording** — `record.format = "hevc"` is now accepted on
Maruko, matching Star6E.  The pipeline holds parallel `ts_recorder`
and `recorder` (Star6eRecorderState) state; format dispatch happens
at start and selects which one consumes the chn 0 / chn 1 stream.
A new `src/maruko_recorder.c` adapter walks `i6c_venc_strm` with the
same iovec-collected `writev` pattern as `star6e_recorder.c`,
reusing all the disk-space / sync_file_range plumbing.

Both modes verified on 192.168.2.12 via WebUI: 3760×2116 HEVC Main
in `.hevc`, HEVC + Opus in `.ts`.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-05-05

TS recorder: universally-decodable audio in `.ts` files.

The recorder previously muxed audio as private-data with an "LPCM"
registration descriptor that no standard player recognised — VLC,
ffmpeg, and mpv treated it as `bin_data` and either dropped it or
played white noise.  Recordings now carry audio in one of two forms,
selected by `audio.codec`:

- `audio.codec = "pcm"` → SMPTE 302M (BSSD).  Broadcast standard for
  16-bit PCM in MPEG-TS.  Mono inputs are upmixed to stereo per the
  302M requirement.  Universally decoded.
- `audio.codec = "opus"` → Opus-in-MPEG-TS provisional mapping.
  Re-uses the same Opus encoder feeding the RTP path, so no extra CPU
  cost.  Each PES carries one Opus access unit prefixed by the
  `0x7FE0` control header.  Recommended — about 30× smaller audio than
  PCM at the same intelligibility.
- `audio.codec = "g711a"` / `"g711u"` → audio is not muxed into the
  recording (no in-band TS framing that VLC/ffmpeg decode without
  hints).  Video-only file.

Filenames now carry a `_opus` or `_pcm` suffix so the codec is visible
without ffprobe (e.g. `rec_02h23m07s_c9e2_opus.ts`).

ts_mux additions:
- `ts_mux_init` gains an `audio_codec` argument
  (`TS_AUDIO_CODEC_PCM_S302M` / `TS_AUDIO_CODEC_OPUS`)
- PMT writer emits the matching registration descriptor (BSSD or Opus)
  plus the Opus extension descriptor with `channel_config_code`
- `ts_mux_write_audio` dispatches: SMPTE 302M packs raw s16le with
  bit-reversal per the AES3 16-bit layout; Opus path wraps each
  pre-encoded packet in the 11-bit prefix + au_size control header
- `star6e_ts_recorder_init` gains an `audio_codec` argument plumbed
  through from `audio.codec`

The Star6E and Maruko audio threads now route the encoded buffer
(rather than raw PCM) into the recording ring when codec is Opus.

Verification:
- Host: 1520 unit tests pass; offline sine encode round-trips
  bit-exact through ffmpeg's SMPTE 302M and Opus parsers.
- Hardware: Star6E bench (`192.168.1.13`, IMX335).  HEVC + audio
  recordings in both modes play directly in VLC, mpv, and ffmpeg.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-03

`video0` digital zoom (Approach C) — Star6E + Maruko parity.

Adds three new `video0` fields driving a 1:1 SCL crop (output dim = crop
dim, no upscale, no bandwidth pressure).  Receivers see the smaller dim
in SPS/PPS; receivers that pin to first SPS render deeper zoom invisibly,
which is why `zoom_pct` is clamped at a 0.25 floor in the parser.

Schema:
- `video0.zoomPct` — `0.0` = zoom OFF (full image); `0.25..1.0` = crop
  fraction (smaller = deeper zoom).  MUT_RESTART (encoder dim change).
- `video0.zoomX`, `video0.zoomY` — crop centre, `0..1` (0 = top/left,
  1 = bottom/right).  MUT_LIVE (no respawn — joystick / head-tracker
  friendly).

Implementation:
- **Star6E**: `MI_VPE_SetPortCrop(0, 0, ...)` on the existing VPE port —
  no new SCL channel, no extra mem.  SCL clock bumped 384 → 432 MHz to
  unblock crop+resize at full sensor input.  Debug OSD canvas stays 1:1
  with the encoded frame (RGN attaches at the post-SCL VPE port output,
  not at VPE input — no per-zoom offset needed).
- **Maruko**: `MI_SCL_SetPortConfig(0,0,0)` carrying both crop and
  output dim atomically.  Output dimensions stay 16-px aligned and crop
  offsets stay 2-px aligned; the smaller dimension drives the crop to
  keep the encoded AR matching the sensor.

Verification:
- Live sweep on both devices: pct ∈ {1.0, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.25} × pan ∈
  {(0.5,0.5), (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0.5,0.5)}.  Star6E sustains
  60 fps, Maruko sustains 30 fps across all combinations.  Pan
  confirmed visually on the live RTP stream for both backends.

## [0.9.16] - 2026-05-03

IntraRefresh: single-knob `intraRefreshMode` enum.

Replaces the boolean `intraRefresh` + two zero-sentinel fields from PR #92
with one human-readable mode picker (`off` | `fast` | `balanced` | `robust`).
Each mode targets a self-heal window (150 ms / 500 ms / 1000 ms) and derives
lines, GOP, and QP from it; per-field overrides remain available.

**Breaking change** (no backward compat): `video0.intraRefresh` boolean is
removed. Configs from 0.9.15 and earlier carrying `intraRefresh: true` will
fall through to `intraRefreshMode: "off"` (default) — re-enable explicitly
via the mode field or `POST /api/v1/intra/mode?mode=balanced`.

Highlights:
- New `src/intra_refresh.{c,h}` shared helper (used by both backends)
  computes lines, auto-GOP (one IDR per full GDR pass), and codec-default
  QP (48 H.265 / 45 H.264 — `u32ReqIQp` is never passed as 0).
- New `POST /api/v1/intra/mode?mode=<name>` endpoint: sets mode, clears
  per-field overrides, persists, reinits. One call to switch presets.
- Extended `/api/v1/intra/status` response: returns mode, target_ms,
  total_rows, and per-field requested-vs-effective for lines/qp/gop.
- Both Star6E and Maruko backends share the helper — drift between
  parallel implementations is no longer possible.
- Schema field `video0.intra_refresh_mode` registered (FT_STRING,
  MUT_RESTART) with `intraRefreshMode` camelCase alias.
- Auto-GOP overrides `gopSize` only when user did not pin a value;
  explicit `gopSize > 0` is honored and logged at boot.
- Contract bump 0.8.4 → 0.9.0 (breaking config field rename).
- 44 new unit tests covering parse, compute, override, clamp, edge cases.

## [0.9.15] - 2026-05-02

Maruko parity Phase 5 — audio capture (Opus / G.711 / raw PCM).

Closes the last big standalone parity gap: Maruko now captures PCM via the
i6c MI_AI ABI, encodes via the shared codec helpers, and ships the result
as RTP (or compact UDP) on `outgoing.audioPort`.  The Phase 6 TS recorder
automatically picks up audio when capture is active — PMT advertises an
audio PID and PCM frames are interleaved by the existing `ts_mux_write_audio`
path that Star6E was already wired to.

What ships:
- `vendor-libs/maruko/libmi_ai.so` (110 KB) and `libmi_ao.so` (85 KB),
  pulled from the SDK uClibc bundle.  AO is reserved for a future Phase 5b
  playback path.  MD5SUMS + README updated.
- New `include/maruko_ai_types.h` carrying the small set of MI_AI types
  used at runtime (Attr / Data / Format / SoundMode / SampleRate / If),
  copied verbatim from the SDK headers so the build stays SDK-header-free.
- New `maruko_ai_impl` shim in `include/maruko_mi.h` + `src/maruko_mi.c`.
  Symbol set: `MI_AI_InitDev` / `DeInitDev` / `Open` / `Close` /
  `AttachIf` / `EnableChnGroup` / `DisableChnGroup` / `Read` /
  `ReleaseData` / `SetMute` / `SetGain` / `SetIfGain`.  Loaded with
  `RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL` and tolerates absence — no `libmi_ai.so` →
  audio disabled but the rest of the pipeline runs unchanged.
- New `src/maruko_audio.c` (~510 LOC) — full capture state machine:
  `Open(dev=0)` + `AttachIf(ADC_AB)` + `SetGain` + `SetMute` +
  `SetChnOutputPortDepth` + `EnableChnGroup`; capture thread on
  `SCHED_FIFO` doing `MI_AI_Read(0, 0, &mic, &echo, 50)` → push
  PCM into the shared `audio_ring`; encode thread does Opus / G.711 /
  L16 byte-swap and ships via RTP packetizer or compact UDP.
- New shared helper `src/audio_codec.{c,h}` — extracted Opus / G.711
  encoders + stdout filter (singleton, refcounted) from
  `src/star6e_audio.c`, ~250 LOC moved.  Star6E side switched to the
  shared helpers; `Star6eAudioState.opus_lib` / `opus_enc` replaced
  by the new `AudioCodecOpus opus`.  No behavioural change on Star6E.
- `MarukoBackendConfig` mirrors `vcfg->audio` + `vcfg->outgoing.audio_port`
  + `outgoing.max_payload_size` so the pipeline can call
  `maruko_audio_init` without taking a `VencConfig` dependency.
- `MarukoBackendContext` gains `audio` (state) + `audio_recorder_ring`
  (bridge from audio encode thread to TS recorder).  Init in
  `maruko_pipeline_configure_graph` after `bind_maruko_pipeline`,
  teardown in `maruko_pipeline_teardown_graph` after `stop_dual` and
  `ts_recorder_stop` so no consumer can race the ring teardown.
- `apply_mute = maruko_audio_apply_mute` in `maruko_controls.c`,
  closing the trivial-after-audio-lands gap from the parity matrix.
- Replaced the `maruko_runtime.c:58-60` "audio output is not supported"
  warning with the live init call.

Verify gate:
- `make verify` passes both backends.
- Bench (192.168.2.12, IMX415): `audio.enabled=true`,
  `audio.codec=opus|g711a|pcm` → `[audio] Initialized` + RTP arrives on
  the configured destination port.  Mute toggle via
  `/api/v1/set?audio.mute=true` cuts audio cleanly.

Caveats:
- The SSC378QE bench's analog mic wiring is unverified.  `MI_AI_Open`
  succeeds and `MI_AI_Read` returns frames, but the actual codec on this
  board may not be wired to a microphone — capture may yield silence.
  The init path still completes successfully so the userspace pipeline
  itself is exercised; an analog mic is a separate hardware fix-up.
- AO (playback) is intentionally not exposed yet — reserved for a
  future Phase 5b once a use case appears.

## [0.9.14] - 2026-05-02

Maruko parity Phase 6 — TS recording (`record.mode="mirror"` / `"dual"`).

Lights up on-device TS-mux recording on Maruko by reusing the Star6E
TS recorder state machine.  Two modes wired:

- **mirror**: chn 0 frames are written to the .ts file alongside the
  RTP stream.  Single encoder, simplest case.
- **dual**: chn 1 (created via Phase 7's `start_dual()`) drains into
  the .ts file while chn 0 keeps streaming RTP to the configured
  destination.  The chn 1 drain thread feeds the recorder; the chn 0
  loop is guarded so it never co-writes.

Audio is video-only for now (no audio backend on Maruko — Phase 5).
Raw `.hevc` format is rejected with a warning; only `format="ts"` is
implemented.

Implementation notes:
- Promoted `src/star6e_recorder.c`, `src/star6e_ts_recorder.c`,
  `src/ts_mux.c` from `STAR6E_ONLY_SRC` to a new `RECORDER_SRC` list
  built by both backends.  No `#ifdef PLATFORM_*` was needed — the
  files only depend on type names from `star6e.h`, which Maruko
  already pulls in for `MI_SYS_ChnPort_t`.
- Added a small adapter `src/maruko_ts_recorder.c` that pulls NAL
  units out of `i6c_venc_strm` (Maruko) and feeds the shared
  `star6e_ts_recorder_write_video()` primitive.  Mirrors
  `star6e_ts_recorder_write_stream()` 1:1.
- `MarukoBackendConfigRecord` extended with `dir`, `format`,
  `max_seconds`, `max_mb` (already present on the generic
  `VencConfigRecord`).
- New `Star6eTsRecorderState ts_recorder` field on
  `MarukoBackendContext`; opened in `configure_graph` after
  `start_dual` so the drain thread sees it ready.  Closed in
  `teardown_graph` after `stop_dual` (no race window).

Verified on 192.168.2.12 (OpenIPC SSC378QE / IMX415, no SD card —
written to `/tmp` tmpfs).  Live test pending in the next session.

Out of scope for this PR (deferred):
- Raw `.hevc` recorder on Maruko (the `_write_frame` adapter still
  takes Star6E's `MI_VENC_Stream_t`; will land alongside Phase 5
  audio if anyone wants it).
- HTTP `/api/v1/record/start|stop` for Maruko (daemon-config-driven
  only for now).
- Audio mux into the TS container (Phase 5).

## [0.9.13] - 2026-05-02

Maruko parity Phase 3 — BMI270 IMU port (opt-in via `imu.enabled`).

Wires the existing platform-agnostic `src/imu_bmi270.c` into the
Maruko pipeline so `imu.enabled=true` reads gyro + accel from a
BMI270 over I2C (frame-synced FIFO mode, 200 Hz default ODR).  The
push callback is currently a stub — samples are read and discarded —
so this lands the lifecycle but no consumer yet.  Future telemetry /
sidecar export plugs into the existing callback slot without touching
init/teardown.

Verified on 192.168.2.12 (OpenIPC SSC378QE / IMX415 1472x816@120,
H.265 25 Mbps RTP):
- BMI270 detected at `0x68` on `/dev/i2c-1` (chip_id=`0x24`).
- 400-sample auto-bias (~2 s) completes cleanly; gyro bias ≈
  (0.005, -0.006, -0.001) rad/s on bench.
- 200 Hz FIFO drain runs every video frame; 1963 samples / 9 s of
  streaming at 118 fps, 0 read errors.

- **Maruko-specific ordering constraint.**  IMU init must run BEFORE
  `MI_VENC_StartRecvPic` (i.e. before `bind_maruko_pipeline()`)
  because the auto-bias loop blocks the main thread for ~2 s
  (400 samples @ 200 Hz).  Empirically on Maruko, blocking the main
  thread for 2 s after StartRecvPic leaves the VENC fd in a state
  where `poll()` never returns POLLIN and the stream loop never
  progresses.  Star6E does not exhibit this — IMU init can stay
  post-VENC there.  The constraint is captured inline in
  `maruko_pipeline_configure_graph()` so future re-orders don't
  regress.
- `src/imu_bmi270.c` moved from `STAR6E_ONLY_SRC` to `HELPER_SRC`
  (already platform-agnostic; no `#ifdef PLATFORM_*` in the file).
- New `imu` field on `MarukoBackendContext` (`ImuState *`, NULL when
  disabled).  `MarukoBackendConfig` carries `VencConfigImu imu`
  embedded from `vcfg->imu` so the pipeline does not reach into
  `VencConfig` directly (consistent with the `show_osd` /
  `keep_aspect` bridge fields).
- Per-frame `imu_drain()` runs in `maruko_pipeline_process_stream()`
  before `MI_VENC_GetStream` (Star6E parity at
  `star6e_runtime.c:727`).  No-op when `ctx->imu == NULL`.
- Stop/destroy in `maruko_pipeline_teardown_graph()` ahead of any
  unbind/stop, mirroring Star6E.
- No config-schema change.  `imu.enabled` default remains `false`,
  so existing setups are untouched.

Maruko parity Phase 9 — opt-in 3A CPU throttle (`isp.aeMode`).

The 1080p120 H.265 25 Mbps profile burned ~62% of a single Cortex-A7
core on Maruko (SSC378QE).  Per-thread sampling pinned ~17.5% to
libcus3a.so's `3A_Proc_0` worker (spawned by `MI_ISP_EnableUserspace3A`,
runs at sensor frame sync) plus matching kernel ISP/VENC kthread time.
The host pipeline was already lean (~3% main thread) so the ceiling
was the per-frame 3A loop — not anything we packetize or send.

The cut: keep `MI_ISP_EnableUserspace3A` so the IQ→HW pump (the same
`3A_Proc_0` thread) keeps writing saturation/sharpness/brightness to
silicon, but swap the SDK's NATIVE AE algorithm for a no-op stub via
`MI_ISP_CUS3A_RegInterfaceEX(ADAPTOR_1)`.  AWB stays NATIVE so white
balance still tracks the scene (the 4096/1024/1024 R/G/B gains in the
SDK demo turned out to be smoke-test values, not calibrated daylight
gains — letting the bin drive AWB gives a usable picture).  AE is
then driven by a 15 Hz supervisory thread (`src/maruko_cus3a.c`) that
reads the 128x90 luminance grid via `MI_ISP_AE_GetAeHwAvgStats` and
applies a three-stage cascade (shutter → sensor gain → ISP digital
gain) via `MI_ISP_CUS3A_SetAeParam`.

- New config field **`isp.aeMode`** (`"native"` default,
  `"throttle"` opt-in).  Default preserves existing behaviour and
  gives a safety hatch if a different sensor / firmware breaks the
  no-op adaptor.  Live mode change requires restart (the adaptor swap
  and `CUS3A_Enable` flags are init-only); SIGHUP at runtime is a
  documented limitation.
- New module **`src/maruko_cus3a.c` + `include/maruko_cus3a.h`**
  (≈700 lines).  `_install_noop_adaptor()` registers the AE stub;
  `_start()` launches the 15 Hz controller thread; `_stop()` joins
  on teardown.  `MarukoCus3aConfig.throttle_mode` gates the
  AE-control law — when 0 the thread still runs cap-enforcement +
  stats reads (Star6E-equivalent behaviour).
- **Pipeline integration** (`src/maruko_pipeline.c`): adaptor install
  is gated on `cfg.ae_mode == "throttle"` after `MI_SNR_SetFps`;
  thread starts when `ae_fps > 0` regardless of mode.  Default-on bin
  gain ceiling switched to `bin_max_sensor_gain` (8192 on IMX415)
  when user sets `gainMax=0`, fixing the previous over-bright bias
  (the old default capped at a 32× synthetic ceiling).
- **Config / fixture**: `config/venc.default.json` adds
  `"aeMode": "native"` so the round-trip layout test passes.

Verified on 192.168.2.12 (SSC378QE / IMX415 1472x816@120fps,
H.265 25 Mbps RTP):
- `aeMode=native` (default): unchanged behaviour, ~50% sys CPU.
- `aeMode=throttle`: ~36% sys CPU (≈24 percentage-point drop on a
  single-core SoC), `3A_Proc_0` ticks 89→36 per 3 s sample, AE
  responds visibly to scene changes at 15 Hz, IQ knobs
  (saturation / sharpness / brightness) still hot-apply.

## [0.9.11] - 2026-05-02

Maruko parity Phase 2b — debug OSD now functional (kernel-oops cured).

Verified on 192.168.2.12 (OpenIPC SSC378QE, kernel 5.10.61): with
`debug.showOsd=true`, RGN init/create/attach/getcanvas all succeed,
encode loop runs at ~117 fps, no kernel taint, OSD canvas mapped at
1472x816 stride 736.

- **Root cause was a build-time conditional bug, not a kernel/lib
  mismatch.**  The Maruko build defines BOTH `-DPLATFORM_STAR6E` and
  `-DPLATFORM_MARUKO` (the Star6E backend's MI shim headers are reused
  for type compatibility; see `Makefile:39`).  In Phase 2,
  `src/debug_osd.c` started with `#ifdef PLATFORM_STAR6E`, so the
  Star6E branch was compiled into the Maruko binary too — and the
  Star6E ABI (1-arg `MI_RGN_Init(palette*)`, mod_id 0 = VPE, 3-arg
  `AttachToChn`) ran against the Maruko kernel/lib pair.  That
  ABI mismatch produced the `MI_DEVICE_Ioctl → kfree → compound_head`
  oops with a userspace-shaped pointer (`r0=0x0f9c0900`) reaching
  kfree.  Fixed by changing the first conditional to
  `#if defined(PLATFORM_STAR6E) && !defined(PLATFORM_MARUKO)` so
  Maruko binaries enter the proper Maruko branch.
- **`debug_osd`: Maruko ABI branch (now active).**  Targets the
  OpenIPC libmi_rgn.so v3 API as documented in the SigmaStar
  Infinity6C BSP headers (`mi_rgn.h`) and used by the vendor's
  official IPC demo (`common/osd/osd.cpp`):
  `MI_RGN_Init(soc_id, palette*)` (palette as direct arg, not wrapped),
  3-arg `MI_RGN_Create(soc_id, handle, attr*)`, 4-arg
  `MI_RGN_AttachToChn(soc_id, handle, chnport*, param*)`, 64-bit
  `MI_PHY` / pointer-width `MI_VIRT` in `MI_RGN_CanvasInfo_t`,
  module ID 34 (`E_MI_MODULE_ID_SCL` — RGN is attached to SCL/0/0/0).
- **`maruko_mi`: pre-load `libmi_rgn.so`.**  Added to the existing
  RTLD_GLOBAL dep chain in `maruko_mi_init()` (alongside
  `libcam_os_wrapper`, `libmi_common`, `libispalgo`, `libcus3a`) so the
  later `dlopen` from `debug_osd.c` finds the dependency graph fully
  resolved.  (`src/maruko_mi.c`)
- **`maruko_pipeline`: init-before-kthread ordering.**  Moved
  `debug_osd_create()` ahead of `bind_maruko_pipeline()` so it runs
  after the SCL channel exists (`maruko_start_vpe`) but BEFORE
  `MI_VENC_StartRecvPic` spawns the encoder kthread.  The v5.10
  OpenIPC kernel mi_rgn driver requires the singlethread workqueue
  to be created from the main task.  Dropped the Phase 2 safety-gate
  WARN-and-skip — the runtime is now real.  (`src/maruko_pipeline.c`)

Recipe cross-referenced with `waybeam-hub/src/rgn_backend_maruko.c`,
which had already verified the dep preload + module-ID-34 pattern
against the same kernel/lib pair (different `MI_RGN_OsdChnPortParam_t`
trailing field — the current SigmaStar Infinity6C BSP `mi_rgn_datatype.h`
omits `stColorInvertAttr` that the hub's older vendored header
includes; both work because the kernel reads only the union prefix).

## [0.9.10] - 2026-05-02

Maruko parity Phase 2 — debug OSD overlay wired to both backends.

- **`maruko_pipeline`: debug OSD plumbed.**  Mirrors Star6E
  (`star6e_runtime.c:825-849`):
  `debug_osd_create()` runs at the end of
  `maruko_pipeline_configure_graph()` after VENC bind+start (gated on
  the new `cfg.show_osd`, sourced from `debug.showOsd`),
  `debug_osd_begin_frame / sample_cpu / text / end_frame` runs
  per frame inside `maruko_pipeline_process_stream()` showing fps + cpu,
  and `debug_osd_destroy()` runs at the top of
  `maruko_pipeline_teardown_graph()` before any unbind/stop.  Both
  backends now share `src/debug_osd.c` + `src/debug_osd_draw.c`
  (moved from `STAR6E_ONLY_SRC` to `HELPER_SRC`).  When
  `debug.showOsd=false` (default) no OSD code runs on either backend.
- **Maruko runtime path safety-gated.**  On the test target
  (192.168.2.12, OpenIPC SSC378QE), invoking `MI_RGN_Init` triggers a
  kernel Oops in `MI_DEVICE_Ioctl` (kfree path) and wedges the encode
  loop — the same lib/kernel SDK vintage mismatch documented in
  `memory/maruko_osd_render_bringup.md`.  Until Phase 2b ships the cure
  (RTLD_GLOBAL dep preload, `MI_MODULE_ID_SCL`=34, init-before-worker-
  thread; tracked in `documentation/MARUKO_PARITY_PLAN.md`),
  `debug.showOsd=true` on Maruko emits a one-time warning and skips the
  attach so a stale config never hangs venc.  Star6E behaviour is
  unchanged.  (`src/maruko_pipeline.c`, `src/maruko_config.c`,
  `include/maruko_config.h`, `include/maruko_pipeline.h`, `Makefile`)

## [0.9.9] - 2026-05-02

Maruko parity Phase 1 — aspect-ratio precrop on the SCL stage.

- **`maruko_pipeline`: SCL precrop wired up.**  `configure_maruko_scl()`
  now writes a centered crop rect into `scl_port.crop` instead of zero
  when `isp.keepAspect=true` and the encode aspect ratio differs from the
  sensor's effective output.  The rect is computed via the existing
  `pipeline_common_compute_precrop()` helper (Star6E parity) against the
  post-binning effective input (`sensor.plane.capt` clamped by
  `mode.output`), so it always matches the surface that actually feeds
  the SCL stage.  Falls back to zero crop (full source area, downstream
  stretch) when `isp.keepAspect=false`.  `venc_api_set_active_precrop()`
  is called on success for `/api/v1/config` visibility, and
  `venc_api_clear_active_precrop()` runs in
  `maruko_pipeline_teardown_graph()` for symmetry with Star6E.  Verified
  on bench (192.168.2.12, IMX415): 960x720 (4:3) on 1920x1080 sensor
  mode → `Precrop: 1920x1080 -> 1440x1080 (offset 240,0)`, encoding
  89 fps @ 25 Mbps without stretching; 1280x720 (16:9) and
  `keepAspect=false` paths both produce the legacy zero-crop output.
  (`src/maruko_pipeline.c`, `src/maruko_config.c`,
  `include/maruko_config.h`, `include/venc_config.h`,
  `documentation/PRECROP_ASPECT_RATIO.md`)

## [0.9.8] - 2026-05-02

Frame-drop fix: relax the SDK FrameLost rate-control threshold from 120% to
150% of target bitrate.  Affects both Star6E and Maruko (shared
`pipeline_common_frame_lost_threshold`).

On Maruko at 5 Mbps / 60 fps, hand-wave motion routinely caused the
encoder's measured output to spike to ~6.0–6.4 Mbps — past the old 120%
floor (6.144 Mbps).  `MI_VENC_SetFrameLostStrategy(NORMAL)` then dropped
whole frames as a safety net, costing 5–10 fps under motion even though
CBR rate control would have absorbed the overshoot in the next few frames
via QP feedback.

Confirmed via per-frame timing on device: user-space loop work stayed
≤230 µs avg / ≤365 µs max (well under the 16.67 ms 60-fps budget) in both
modes; the missing frames were skipped at the SDK encoder layer, not by
FIFO eviction.  Disabling `frameLost` entirely on test eliminated the
drop; raising the threshold to 150% restores the safety net for genuine
sustained network overload (>50% over target) while letting motion bursts
through.

- **`pipeline_common.c::pipeline_common_frame_lost_threshold`**: change
  margin from `bits / 5U` (20%) to `bits / 2U` (50%).  Floor of 524288
  bits (~512 kbps headroom) preserved for low-bitrate streams.
- No config-schema change.  `frameLost` default remains `true`.

Verified on 192.168.2.12 (SSC378QE / IMX415 @1920x1080 / 60 fps,
H.265 5 Mbps RTP): under continuous hand-wave motion, app-observed FPS
stays at 59 (vs 54–55 before); on-device VENC frame-arrival jitter goes
from 33.3 ms (one-frame skip) to a flat 16.7 ms.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-05-02

May 2026 code-review follow-up bundle (PRs P1+P2+P3+P4+P5 squashed).

- **P2 — `httpd`: Content-Length parser anchored.**  The HTTP request
  parser previously located `Content-Length:` via an unanchored
  case-insensitive substring search across the entire header block,
  which would latch onto the literal substring inside an arbitrary
  header value (e.g. `X-Forwarded: content-length:99`).  Fix walks
  the header block line by line and only matches at the start of a
  line.  Eliminates a request-smuggling vector against the live
  config / set endpoints; also drops the now-unused
  `httpd_strcasestr` helper.  (`src/venc_httpd.c`)

- **P4 — Move orphaned `snr_*` harnesses to `tools/`.**
  `snr_sequence_probe.c` and `snr_toggle_test.c` were never wired
  into the build (orphaned since 0.6.2).  Relocated under `tools/`
  to match the rest of the standalone diagnostic harnesses; updated
  the path reference in `documentation/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`.  No
  Makefile changes required.

- **P3 — `main`: pidfile + flock single-instance gate.**  The legacy
  guard scanned `/proc/*/comm` for a process named `venc`, which is
  inherently racy: two near-simultaneous launches each see no peer
  and both proceed to grab the SHM ring.  New `acquire_pidfile_lock()`
  takes an exclusive non-blocking `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on
  `/var/run/venc.pid` (falling back to `/tmp/venc.pid`) before the
  legacy `/proc` scan; `EWOULDBLOCK` exits cleanly with rc=1.  The
  fd is held with `O_CLOEXEC` and intentionally leaked so the kernel
  releases the lock at process exit even on SIGKILL.  Old `/proc`
  fallback retained as defence-in-depth for the case where pidfile
  lock acquisition itself fails (e.g. read-only fs).  Updated comment
  in `src/venc_ring.c` to reference the new mechanism.
  (`src/main.c`, `src/venc_ring.c`)

- **P1 — `venc_api`: shrink `g_cfg_mutex` hold time.**  The live-set
  apply path held `g_cfg_mutex` across `stage_params_into_cfg` and
  `preflight_live_group_callbacks` even though both operate purely
  on stack-local config copies and do not read or mutate the shared
  `g_cfg` pointer.  Moved both calls outside the mutex region; the
  mutex is now only held during `apply_live_group_sequence_locked`,
  which is the irreducible window where backend `apply_*` callbacks
  read additional vcfg fields beyond their parameters via the
  registered `&ctx->vcfg`.  No behavior change; reduces serialization
  in the rapid-fire `/api/v1/set` path used by the link_controller.
  Documented the irreducible hold-time contract in the mutex
  declaration's doc comment.  (`src/venc_api.c`)

  Note on scope: the original CR claim of "torn-string reads at
  120 fps" did not match any reachable code path — backend reads
  of `vcfg->...` strings happen only at init/teardown or inside
  the `apply_*` callbacks (under the mutex).  The deeper deferred
  work-queue rework deferred until the apply-callback contract is
  changed.

- **P5 — `maruko_pipeline_run()` split.**  Reduced from 301 lines
  to ~50 by extracting `maruko_pipeline_init_streaming`,
  `maruko_pipeline_cleanup_streaming`,
  `maruko_pipeline_check_idle_abort`,
  `maruko_pipeline_await_frame`,
  `maruko_pipeline_process_stream`, and
  `maruko_pipeline_log_verbose_frame` into `MarukoStreamRuntime`
  helpers.  Outer loop now mirrors the Star6E shape
  (`star6e_runner_run` + `star6e_runtime_process_stream`).
  Behavior preserved: idle-abort timer (`MARUKO_IDLE_ABORT_US`),
  idle-warn timer (`MARUKO_IDLE_WARN_US`), FPS-kick, pressure-gating,
  verbose-cadence (`MARUKO_PKTZR_VERBOSE_ACTIVE`), cached pack
  reuse, POLLERR fallback.  (`src/maruko_pipeline.c`)

- **Tests.**  `tests/test_venc_httpd.c` gains coverage of the new
  Content-Length walker (anchored match, case-insensitive,
  multi-header, header-value-confused-with-body, missing/oversized,
  negative).  `scripts/test_pidfile_lock.sh` exercises the flock
  gate by launching two short-lived test processes and asserting
  the second exits with `EWOULDBLOCK`.  Existing `test_multi_set_*`
  cases continue to cover the now-mutex-free stage/preflight path
  in `apply_live_set_query`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-28

Transport-pressure observability (the prior "Level 2 — local FPS skip"
plan was rolled back; see the post-encode-skip note at the end of this
section).

- **Universal fill source.** Producer-local backpressure now works
  uniformly for every output transport with a queue model:
    `shm://`   `(write_idx - read_idx) / slot_count`
    `unix://`  `SIOCOUTQ / SO_SNDBUF`
    `udp://`   `SIOCOUTQ / SO_SNDBUF`
  For UDP-over-WiFi the kernel send queue rarely fills (NIC drains
  fast) so the gate is a no-op in practice and the radio-link layer
  (`waybeam_wfb_ng/link_controller`) does the actual adaptive control.
  For local UDP and unix:// (e.g. gstreamer consumer) a slow consumer
  fills the kernel queue and the gate trips correctly — empirically
  validated on Linux 6.x by sending raw datagrams to a non-reading
  receiver and watching SIOCOUTQ rise to SO_SNDBUF cap.
- **Level 1 — observability.** New `GET /api/v1/transport/status`
  endpoint returns the active output transport (`"shm"` / `"udp"` /
  `"unix"` discriminator), queue fill, lifetime delivery counters
  (SHM only — `packetsSent`, `transportDrops`, `oversizeDrops`),
  live watermark config, current hysteresis state (`inPressure`),
  and the producer-local `pressureDrops` counter (all transports).
  Also new `query_transport_status` callback in `VencApplyCallbacks`
  (Star6E + Maruko both implement).  For unix:// / udp:// the
  socket-side lifetime counters are not yet tracked — `transportDrops`
  and `packetsSent` are absent from the JSON for those transports;
  the sidecar trailer carries 0s.  Future work: count
  sendmsg(EAGAIN/ENOBUFS) and successful sends in `output_socket_send_parts`.
- **Sidecar trailer.** `RTP_SIDECAR_FLAG_TRANSPORT_INFO` (0x04) +
  `RtpSidecarTransportInfoWire` (16 bytes).  Appended after the
  optional ENC_INFO trailer when any non-zero transport is active.
  Forward-compat: probes that don't recognise the flag read just the
  base frame (and ENC_INFO if present) and ignore the trailing bytes
  — no protocol version bump.
- **Hysteresis-driven pressure flag (telemetry only).**  Hardcoded
  watermarks `VENC_PRESSURE_HIGH_WATER_PCT=75` /
  `VENC_PRESSURE_LOW_WATER_PCT=50` in `venc_ring.h` — no live config
  surface.  Enter pressure when fill_pct ≥ HIGH, exit when fill_pct
  < LOW.  The flag flows out through the sidecar trailer
  (`in_pressure`) and through `/api/v1/transport/status`.  The
  `pressureDrops` counter increments while the flag is asserted and
  serves as a "frames-spent-in-pressure" metric for adaptive
  consumers.  **The producer never skips a frame on the basis of
  this flag** — see the rollback note below.
- **Auto-gated observation.** `*_observe_pressure` is only called
  per-frame when a sidecar probe is subscribed
  (`rtp_sidecar_is_subscribed`); when nobody is listening, the SIOCOUTQ
  ioctl / ring-fill load is skipped entirely.  Observation caches its
  fill_pct + lifetime stats into the output struct so the sidecar emit
  in the same frame reads the cache instead of re-querying — one
  query per frame on the producer hot path instead of two.  No live
  config surface for backpressure: prior `outgoing.backpressure /
  highWaterPct / lowWaterPct` knobs were dropped (the value never
  affected anything outside the trailer once frame-skip was rolled
  back, and exposing tuning knobs for a passive telemetry signal was
  noise).
- **Architecture note.** The hysteresis state machine sits on a
  pre-computed `fill_pct` (`venc_observe_pressure` in `venc_ring.h`)
  so each backend's `*_observe_pressure` is a transport-dispatch
  helper: pick the fill source, hand it to the shared state machine,
  cache the result.  Adding a new transport is one branch in
  `observe_pressure` + one branch in `query_transport_status`.
- **Internal/wire renames.**  Identifiers were scoped from "shm_*" to
  "transport_*" / "backpressure_*" before any consumer shipped, on
  the basis that the model is equally meaningful for any transport
  with a queue.  No deprecated aliases retained — PR isn't merged
  yet so churn cost is zero.
- **Post-encode frame-skip rolled back.** The original PR also shipped
  a producer-side skip path: when the hysteresis flag was asserted,
  `star6e_runtime` and `maruko_pipeline` would bypass
  `*_video_send_frame` entirely, advance the RTP timestamp, and emit
  a sidecar message with `seq_count=0`.  Hardware testing showed the
  approach was fundamentally broken for inter-frame-coded video:
  H.264 / H.265 P-frames reference the previous frame in the GOP, so
  dropping one P-frame leaves every following P-frame in that GOP
  undecodable at the receiver.  With `gopSize=5` at 120 fps, a
  pressure storm that "looked clean" on producer-side counters
  (`packetsSent` and `transport_drops` matched `bp=ON` baseline)
  produced unreconstructable garbage at the decoder.  The skip path
  has been removed.  Adaptation under link saturation belongs
  upstream of encode — either lowering `video0.bitrate` (which
  link_controller already does from radio stats and the trailer
  signal) or lowering encoder fps (sensor-side / `MI_SYS_BindChnPort2`
  divider).  The trailer / status endpoint / hysteresis state machine
  remain valuable as a fast pressure signal for adaptive consumers;
  they just no longer pretend to act on it locally.
- **Tests added / kept:**
  - Star6E hysteresis state machine — telemetry assertions only
    (`test_star6e_output_backpressure_hysteresis`)
  - UNIX datagram pressure observation with a non-reading receiver
    (`test_star6e_output_unix_backpressure`)
  - Always-send invariant under pressure
    (`test_star6e_output_always_sends_under_pressure`)
  - Wire-layout for {enc, transport} combinations
    (`test_star6e_video_sidecar_transport_layouts`)
- **Stale-ring hardening.** `venc_ring_create()` now `shm_unlink()`s
  the name before `O_EXCL`-creating a fresh inode, instead of
  `O_CREAT|O_TRUNC` reusing the existing one. After a SIGKILL'd venc
  is restarted while the old wfb_tx still has the ring mmapped, the
  old consumer keeps reading the orphaned inode (no SIGBUS, no race
  through magic=0/init_complete=0) until its watchdog detaches and
  re-attaches by name to the new inode. Pairs with the consumer-side
  per-iter epoch guard in `waybeam_wfb_ng/poc/shm-input.patch`. New
  regression test: `test_producer_restart_orphans_old_inode`.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-28

Live `outgoing.max_payload_size` (`/api/v1/set?outgoing.maxPayloadSize=...`):

- **Promoted from `MUT_RESTART` to `MUT_LIVE`.** The new size takes effect
  on the next encoded frame; the in-flight frame finishes packetizing at
  the old size, so a switch can never tear a single frame's FU/AP
  fragmentation. Composes with other live fields in a single multi-set
  request, e.g. `?video0.bitrate=8000&outgoing.maxPayloadSize=4000`.
- **Range validated to `[576, 4000]`** in `validate_field_cfg()`. Same
  validation now also gates boot via `venc_api_validate_loaded_config()`,
  so a bad on-disk config refuses to start instead of crashing later.
  4000 is sized for jumbo-frame links such as Realtek's 3993-byte MTU
  (4000 + 12 RTP + 8 UDP + 20 IP = 4040, fits comfortably).
- **Per-slot scratch bumped from 1616 → 4096 bytes** in both backends
  (`STAR6E_OUTPUT_BATCH_SLOT_SCRATCH`, `MARUKO_OUTPUT_BATCH_SLOT_SCRATCH`).
  Required so the sendmmsg() batch can hold an AP packet up to the new
  4000-byte limit. ~159 KiB extra per backend (64 slots × 2.4 KiB delta).
- **SHM parity with UDP/Unix.** SHM rings are sized at startup to fit
  the validated ceiling (`VENC_OUTPUT_PAYLOAD_CEILING_BYTES + 12` =
  4012 bytes per slot, 8-byte aligned), so `shm://` accepts the full
  live range without a restart-to-grow caveat. Costs ~1.3 MiB extra SHM
  per ring vs. the previous "size to configured starting value" scheme,
  but this is paid only when SHM output is actually configured. UDP and
  Unix datagram transports have no transport-level cap — only the
  validated range and scratch ceiling apply.
- **wfb_tx (or any SHM consumer) compatibility note.** The published
  `slot_data_size` in the ring header changes from
  `startup_max_payload + 12` (typically 1412) to a fixed 4012 after this
  release. Well-behaved consumers using `venc_ring_attach()` already
  read `slot_data_size` from the header and compute slot stride from
  it, so they handle the change automatically. A consumer that hard-
  codes a 1412-byte slot stride or uses a fixed-size read buffer below
  4012 will need to be updated.
- **Audio path tracks live updates too.** `Star6eAudioOutput.max_payload_size`
  is now updated in the live apply alongside the video state, so audio
  compact-mode chunking uses the new value on the next audio frame
  (RTP audio doesn't fragment, so the field is unused there but kept in
  sync for future-proofing).
- New optional callback `VencApplyCallbacks.apply_max_payload_size`,
  implemented in `star6e_controls.c` (covers dual-stream second channel)
  and `maruko_controls.c`.
- Cleanups while in the area:
  - `Star6eOutputSetup.max_frame_size` field and the
    `max_payload` parameter to `maruko_output_init_shm` were both
    rendered dead by sizing SHM rings to the ceiling; removed along
    with the now-redundant `*_output_max_payload_cap` helpers and
    SHM cap checks (validation is the single gate).
  - Removed a stale `outgoing.max_payload_size` paragraph in
    `HTTP_API_CONTRACT.md` that described an "adaptive algorithm" no
    longer in the codebase.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-26

Two themes shipped together:

### SIGHUP / `/api/v1/restart` cold restart via fork+exec (Star6E)

SIGHUP / `/api/v1/restart` rebuild the full pipeline including a
sensor-mode change, via process-level fork+exec respawn (Star6E).

- **Single reinit path.**  `SIGHUP`, `GET /api/v1/restart`,
  `GET /api/v1/defaults`, and `MUT_RESTART` `/api/v1/set` all enqueue
  the same request: clean teardown of the running venc, fork a child
  that execv's `/proc/self/exe`, parent exits.  The child inherits
  zero MI/ISP/sensor state from the kernel driver — it's a true cold
  boot at the SDK level, identical to a `killall venc; venc &` cycle.
- **`venc_api_request_reinit()` collapsed** from `int mode` (0/1/2
  priority queueing) to bool.  Every call site — SIGHUP handler,
  `/api/v1/restart`, `/api/v1/defaults`, `MUT_RESTART` set — enqueues
  the same request.
- **Removed:** `star6e_pipeline_reinit()` and
  `star6e_pipeline_stop_venc_level()` (partial-reinit codepath
  replaced by process-level respawn).  See git history for the
  abandoned escape hatch.
- **New helpers:**
  - `star6e_runtime_respawn_pending()` — `main()` checks this after
    backend teardown.
  - `star6e_runtime_respawn_after_exit()` — fork+execv successor.
  - `prctl(PR_SET_NAME, "venc-wd")` in the watchdog fork so the new
    venc's `is_another_venc_running()` skips it.
- **Audio `g_ai_persist` hack kept** — pipeline_stop's
  MI_AI_Disable cycle deadlocks `CamOsMutexLock` and would hang the
  parent's teardown past the watchdog window.  Kernel cleans up AI
  state on process exit anyway.
- **Watchdog timeouts** (process exit only): `alarm()` 5 → 2 s,
  watchdog poll 8 × 1 s → 6 × 500 ms, post-`SIGKILL` grace 3 → 1 s,
  VENC drain 500 → 150 ms.  ISP channel wait kept at 2000 ms (bench
  testing showed cuts cause "ISP channel readiness timeout" warnings).
- Maruko backend untouched (the rcvalue-vs-bool ripple from the
  reinit signature change is the only edit; the Maruko in-process
  reinit path stays).
- Docs: `documentation/SIGHUP_REINIT.md` rewritten with the
  fork+exec design and full bench evidence;
  `documentation/LIVE_FPS_CONTROL.md` "Mode Switching Limitation"
  section removed; `documentation/CRASH_LOG.md` added with the
  sysrq-b remote-recovery trick.

**Bench validation (2026-04-26, imx335 @ 192.168.1.13):** 24/24
consecutive cross-mode SIGHUPs (modes 0→1→2→3, 6 rounds) with no
degradation, no zombies, no dmesg faults.  Cycle time 393–795 ms to
respawn marker; ~13 s to new venc HTTP up (cold start dominates).
Phase 1 plan's in-process `MI_SYS_Exit` + `MI_SYS_Init` approach was
empirically disproven (PID-tied "already_inited" flags trip
`MI_DEVICE_Open` hangs); partial-reinit-without-MI_SYS-Exit survives
~4 cycles before VIF bindmode sync errors.  Process-level respawn is
the only path that scales.

### Hand-rolled config pretty printer (stable disk layout for `/etc/venc.json`)

- **Replace `cJSON_Print` in `venc_config_save`** with a hand-rolled
  emitter (`config_render_pretty` in `src/venc_config.c`). Every WebUI
  `/api/v1/set` save and every `record.path` save now produces the same
  canonical layout: 2-space indent, one key per line, `": "` separator,
  no blank lines between sections, single trailing newline. cJSON's
  tab-indented "shattered" pretty print is gone from the disk path.
  Parsing and HTTP API responses still use cJSON unchanged.
- **Unified layout for `config/venc.default.json`.** The hand-authored
  irregular layout (some sections one-line, others multi-line, mixed
  per-section indent rules) is replaced by the same canonical layout the
  printer emits, so the default file matches what venc actually writes
  on first save.
- **Self-policing round-trip test** (`test_save_layout_byte_equal` in
  `tests/test_venc_config.c`): loads `config/venc.default.json`, saves
  via `venc_config_save`, asserts the saved bytes are byte-equal to the
  original. Any future config field added to the struct/parser/serializer
  but missing from the printer (or the default file) trips the test.
- **`AGENTS.md` sync rules updated**: the per-section `render_*` helper
  in `src/venc_config.c` is now an explicit sync point alongside the
  struct, parser/serializer, API field+alias tables, WebUI `SECTIONS[]`,
  and `config/venc.default.json`.
## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-25

SD-card recording browser (dashboard tab + JSON API):

- **New `Recordings` tab on the dashboard** (`web/dashboard.html`).
  Fourth tab next to `Settings | API Reference | Image Quality`; the
  REC indicator in the top bar is now clickable and switches to it.
  Lists `.ts`/`.hevc` files in the configured `record.dir`, shows
  free/total bytes, current `record.mode`, live `recording:` state
  with frames + bytes + segment counter, start/stop buttons, per-file
  download + delete.  A 2 s poll of `/api/v1/recordings` +
  `/api/v1/record/status` runs while the tab is visible so the active
  recording's counters tick live; interval is cleared on tab switch.
- **Mode-aware start/stop gating.**  When `record.mode` is `dual` or
  `dual-stream` and `record.enabled` is true, the dedicated recording
  thread owns the recorder and the runtime silently skips the HTTP
  `/api/v1/record/start|stop` poll (`star6e_runtime.c`'s `if (!ps->dual)`
  guard).  The tab now reads `record.mode` from `/api/v1/config` and
  disables the Start/Stop buttons with a reason note in those cases,
  instead of letting clicks succeed but produce nothing.  Full truth
  table in `README.md`.
- **New JSON endpoints** (documented in `HTTP_API_CONTRACT.md`):
  - `GET /api/v1/recordings` — list files with `name`, `size`, `mtime`
    plus `free_bytes` / `total_bytes`.  Built in a growing heap buffer
    with proper JSON escaping (no silent truncation, no corruption of
    filenames containing `"` or `\`).  Capped at 512 entries; the
    response includes a `truncated` flag that the UI surfaces as a
    warning so the user doesn't assume old files vanished.
  - `GET /api/v1/recordings/download?file=<name>` — streams the file
    via the new shared `httpd_send_file()` helper (`send(MSG_NOSIGNAL)`
    so a mid-download client disconnect can't kill the server; RFC 5987
    `filename*=UTF-8''…` header).
  - `GET /api/v1/recordings/delete?file=<name>` — `unlink()`.  Refuses
    the currently-recording file by comparing inodes via `(dev, ino)`
    (a path-string compare would be defeated by trailing slashes or
    symlinks); returns 409 `record_active` in that case.
- **Shared httpd plumbing**, reusable by future endpoints:
  - `httpd_query_param()` — URL-decoding (percent + `+`) query parser
    in `venc_httpd.c`.
  - `httpd_send_file()` — streams a file with proper `Content-Length`
    and `Content-Disposition`; shares socket helpers already used by
    the rest of the server.
  - `venc_api_get_record_dir()` + `venc_api_fill_record_status()` —
    mutex-safe accessors exposing the active config directory + live
    recorder state (used to safely read config from the httpd thread).
- **Safety.**  Filenames validated (no path separators, no leading `.`,
  no control bytes); all JSON output properly escaped; no large stack
  frames on the httpd thread (entries buffer is `calloc`'d).
- **HTTP API contract** bumped `0.6.2` → `0.6.3` (non-breaking: three
  new endpoints, one new error code `record_active`).
- **Tests.**  `tests/test_venc_httpd.c` +11 cases for
  `httpd_query_param` covering percent-decoding, `+` → space, UTF-8,
  prefix collisions, empty values, trailing / invalid `%`, and buffer
  truncation safety.
- **Build.**  `tools/build_webui.py` and Makefile updated: dashboard
  blob re-regenerated from `web/dashboard.html`; new `src/venc_recordings.c`
  added to `CONFIG_SRC` and `TEST_LIB_SRCS`.

Implements the intent of PR #48 (PaddyP90) while fixing the safety
bugs flagged in that review: filename validation including `..`, JSON
escaping, heap buffer sizing, disconnect handling, and mutex-safe
config access.  Star6E only; Maruko lacks the `MI_VENC_TS_RECORDER`
plumbing so `/api/v1/record/status` reports `active: false`
there — but the list/download/delete endpoints still work for files
placed in `record.dir` by other means.

Originally drafted as a 0.7.12 fork-only release before the v0.8.0
upstream catch-up; rebased onto v0.8.0 and re-released as 0.8.1.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-25

Drop the EIS module and migrate the Star6E debug OSD from
`MI_RGN_PIXFMT_ARGB4444` (16 bpp) to `MI_RGN_PIXFMT_I4` (4 bpp,
two pixels per byte).  Major bump because `eis.*` config fields and
the EIS internal headers are removed; nothing else in the public HTTP
API or config schema breaks.

### EIS removal

An empirical sensor-mode sweep on Star6E IMX335 established that EIS
only worked in one validated config (sensor mode 3 native 1920x1080
+ real IMU + ≤90 fps); every other combination silently stalled the
encoder via `MI_VPE_SetPortCrop` interactions with VPE scaling,
VIF-side crop, or pixel-rate ceilings.  Increasingly elaborate guards
were added to refuse EIS in the broken cases, but the surface area
isn't worth maintaining for a single-config feature, and a future
LDC-warp rewrite (Phase C in `documentation/EIS_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`)
would replace this code anyway.

- **Removed:** `src/eis.c`, `src/eis_gyroglide.c`, `include/eis.h`,
  `include/eis_gyroglide.h`, `include/eis_ring.h`,
  `tests/test_eis_gyroglide.c` (~1100 LoC).
- **Pipeline init:** EIS init/teardown blocks deleted from
  `bind_and_finalize_pipeline()` and `pipeline_stop()` /
  `pipeline_stop_venc_level()`.  All VPE-scaling / VIF-crop / testMode /
  pixel-rate refusal guards are gone with them — they only existed to
  make EIS misconfiguration loud.
- **Per-frame:** `eis_update()` removed from
  `star6e_runtime_process_stream()`.  `imu_drain()` still runs
  per-frame so a future telemetry consumer slots in cheaply.
- **OSD:** EIS visualization (1/3-scale crop miniature in
  bottom-right + crop/off/margin text rows) removed from
  `star6e_runtime.c`.  Debug OSD now shows only fps and CPU.
- **Config:** `eis.*` fields dropped from `VencConfig`,
  `venc.default.json`, the `/api/v1/set` snake-case alias map,
  and the WebUI dashboard (tab + tooltips + enum).
- **IMU module retained.**  `src/imu_bmi270.c` + `include/imu_bmi270.h`
  stay in the build; `imu.enabled` defaults to `false` so the BMI270
  is never opened unless explicitly enabled.  The push callback
  `star6e_pipeline_imu_push()` is now a stub — samples are discarded
  unless a future consumer (telemetry export, gcsv-style file logging
  for Gyroflow post-process) is wired in.

### Debug OSD: ARGB4444 → I4 format migration

Two-step migration delivered in one release.  First the rasterizer is
extracted into a pure host-testable module, then the MI_RGN backing
format is dropped from 16 bpp ARGB4444 → 8 bpp I8 → 4 bpp I4
palette-indexed.  Canvas footprint at 1920x1080 goes from 4.0 MB to
1.0 MB; OSD-on CPU drops by 74 % on Star6E IMX335.  Encoder hot path
is unchanged — the win is entirely in the OSD-on cost.

- **Pure rasterizer extracted.**  New `src/debug_osd_draw.{c,h}` holds
  the font, palette, dirty-rect logic, and drawing primitives.  The
  MI_RGN glue in `src/debug_osd.c` is now a thin wrapper.  The pure
  module compiles on the host and is exercised by
  `tests/test_debug_osd.c` (76 assertions covering every primitive,
  clipping, dirty-rect expansion, glyph rendering, and hashed
  composite-scene goldens).
- **OsdCanvas API.**  `stride_px` renamed to `stride_bytes` (now bytes
  per row regardless of pixel format).  `width` is still logical
  pixels.  `osd_fill_pixels(canvas, x, y, count, color)` handles I4
  nibble alignment internally:
    - Unaligned start (odd x): RMW the high nibble of byte (x/2).
    - Byte-aligned middle: `memset` the doubled-nibble byte
      `(color << 4) | color` over `(end - x) / 2` bytes.
    - Unaligned tail (end odd): RMW the low nibble of the last byte.
  Drawing primitives (`osd_draw_rect`, `osd_draw_char`) call this in
  place of their old byte-pointer inline math.  `osd_get_pixel` reads
  back the unpacked nibble through the same code path the rasterizer
  uses; production drawing never reads back.
- **Palette: 16 entries** (was 256 in I8, ARGB4444 in 16 bpp).
  Entries 1..8 map to `DEBUG_OSD_*` color constants; semi-transparent
  entries reuse the 4-bit ARGB4444 codes (0x4 → 68, 0xA → 170) so
  visual output is unchanged vs. the ARGB4444 implementation.  Entries
  9..15 are zeroed reserved.
- **MI_RGN region pixfmt:** `MI_RGN_PIXFMT_I4`.  Wire stride at
  1920x1080 is 960 bytes (was 1920 for I8; 3840 for ARGB4444).
- **Track-points use case** (filled small rects from upstream PR #23,
  motion-vector markers): supported unchanged via existing
  `debug_osd_rect` API; dirty-rect tracking gives sub-canvas clear,
  more efficient than the upstream's full-canvas `memset(0xFF)`.
- **Public API source-compatible.**  `debug_osd_rect/point/line/text`
  signatures unchanged; `DEBUG_OSD_*` constants are still palette
  indices (now 0..15 max).

Hardware comparison (Star6E IMX335 @ 90 fps, 30 s samples):

| Format          | Actual fps | CPU/core   | OSD-on cost vs baseline |
|-----------------|-----------:|-----------:|------------------------:|
| ARGB4444 (pre)  |      87.00 |    26.80 % |              +20.53 pp |
| I8 (intermediate) |    90.00 |    17.43 % |              +11.30 pp |
| **I4 (this)**   |  **90.00** | **11.70 %** |          **+5.43 pp** |

I4 cuts OSD CPU −74 % vs the original ARGB4444 path, and hits 2.36×
the fps-per-CPU% of ARGB4444 (7.69 vs 3.25).

### Bundles fork-only history

This release subsumes fork-only intermediate tags 0.7.12 (OSD I8
extraction), 0.7.13 (OSD I8 → I4), and 0.7.14 (EIS removal).  Bundled
because they share a hardware test footprint and were never released
upstream as separate tags.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-04-19

Pre-merge review fixes prior to upstream sync.  Two functional bugs
plus four polish items, all verified end-to-end on Star6E (IMX335 at
192.168.1.13) and Maruko (IMX415 at 192.168.2.12).

- **B1 — Maruko: split ISP-bin gate from CUS3A gate.**  v0.7.10's
  auto-detect fallback was silently a no-op on Maruko reinit because
  both `pipeline_common_resolve_isp_bin` and `maruko_load_isp_bin`
  were gated under `g_mi_isp_initialized`, which is set once and never
  cleared.  Resolve+load now runs every configure with a Star6E-style
  `g_last_isp_bin_path` cache; CUS3A enable + cold-boot exposure cap
  stay one-shot under the deadlock-protection gate.  Verified: 3
  successive `/api/v1/restart` cycles transitioned configured ->
  auto-detect fallback -> new configured -> restored.
- **B2 — IDR rate limiter: CAS loop for thread-safe spacing.**  The
  load-then-store pattern on `last_us` left a race where two
  concurrent producers could both pass the spacing check on the same
  `last` value and both honor an IDR inside the window — the exact
  storm-coalescing guarantee the gate was added for.  Replaced with
  `__atomic_compare_exchange_n` so exactly one caller wins each
  window.  ACQ_REL on the winning store synchronizes with the next
  caller's ACQUIRE load.  Verified: 100 concurrent `/request/idr` ->
  9 honored / 91 dropped (~10 honored/s, matches 100 ms spacing over
  the ~1 s curl burst).  All 18 idr_rate_limit unit tests still pass.
- **M1 — `venc_config_save`: preserve symlinks + mode bits.**  Resolve
  `path` via `readlink()` before writing the temp file so a symlinked
  `/etc/venc.json` is replaced in-place rather than being replaced by
  a regular file.  Preserve the existing target's mode bits via
  `stat()`+`fchmod()` so saves no longer silently widen 0600/0640 to
  0644.  Open the directory with `O_DIRECTORY`, propagate dir-fsync
  errors, retry trailing-newline write on EINTR.  Verified live:
  symlink intact, target mode 0640 preserved.
- **M2 — `/api/v1/defaults`: pick reinit mode based on save success.**
  The handler unconditionally requested reinit mode 1
  (reload-from-disk).  On disk-save failure (`EROFS` / `ENOSPC` /
  perm), the reload silently overlaid the stale on-disk config onto
  the in-memory defaults and reverted most of them.  Use mode 2
  (apply in-memory) when `save_rc != 0` so the operator at least gets
  the defaults they asked for at runtime.
- **M3 / L1 / L3 — Star6E hygiene.**
  - `prepare_pipeline_config`: stale comment about isp_bin_path
    resolution location refreshed (v0.7.10 moved it from
    `select_and_configure_sensor` to `bind_and_finalize_pipeline`).
  - `stop_venc_level`: stop and join `dual_rec_thread` BEFORE
    `star6e_output_teardown(&dual->output)`.  The thread calls
    `star6e_video_send_frame(&dual->output, ...)` inside its loop;
    tearing down output first left a use-after-close window.
  - `dual_rec_thread_fn`: always `usleep` after Query-empty (100 us on
    the fd path, 1 ms on the fallback) to prevent a runaway spin if
    the kernel ever signals POLLIN spuriously without a matching
    packet.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-04-19

Discoverable defaults + automatic ISP-bin selection:

- **`config/venc.default.json` lists `video0.size`.**  The field defaulted
  to `"auto"` in the parser but wasn't in the reference JSON, so users
  copying the file as a template never saw it.  Added with the same
  `"auto"` value.
- **Automatic ISP-bin fallback (both backends).**  New
  `pipeline_common_resolve_isp_bin()` runs after `sensor_select` and:
  1. Uses `isp.sensorBin` if non-empty and readable.
  2. Otherwise tries `/etc/sensors/<lowercase prefix>.bin` keyed off the
     live sensor name (`IMX335_MIPI` → `imx335`).
  3. Falls back to "no bin" (driver defaults).

  Stock devices that already ship `/etc/sensors/imx335.bin`,
  `/etc/sensors/imx415.bin`, etc. now run without per-host config.  A
  configured-but-missing path logs a warning and uses the fallback so
  typos and renamed bin files no longer cripple AE/AWB.  Logs the
  resolution decision once per pipeline start: `> ISP bin: %s
  (configured | auto-detected for sensor 'imx335') | none (no fallback…)`.
- **Star6E `Star6ePipelineConfig.isp_bin_path`** changed from
  `const char *` to `char[256]` to hold the resolved path.  Maruko
  `MarukoBackendConfig.isp_bin_path` got the same treatment.
- **Tests.**  10 new cases in `test_pipeline_common`: configured +
  readable, configured + missing, NULL/empty sensor name, no-alnum-prefix
  sensor name, NULL/zero output buffer (1190 tests, was 1180).

## [0.7.9] - 2026-04-19

Aspect-ratio crop is now opt-out (Star6E):

- **`isp.keepAspect` config (default `true`).** When `false`, VIF
  captures the full sensor area and VPE stretches it to the encode
  dimensions instead of center-cropping to preserve geometry. New
  parameter on `pipeline_common_compute_precrop()` keeps both call sites
  branch-free. Maruko parses but ignores the field until SCL crop port
  lands.
- **Reinit path now tracks the precrop currently programmed in VIF**
  (`state->active_precrop`) and compares against the freshly computed
  rect. A `keepAspect` toggle that doesn't change image dimensions now
  correctly triggers a VIF+VPE reconfigure. The previous code only
  re-armed precrop when `image_width`/`height` differed from the prior
  config.
- **Reinit branch reorganized.** `if (precrop_changed)` runs the full
  VIF+VPE rebuild; `else if (dims_changed)` falls through to the
  VPE-port-only resize. Equal-on-both-counts skips the block. The prior
  shape (outer `if (dims_changed)` then inner precrop check) couldn't
  express the keepAspect-toggle case, and the obvious patch-style fix
  would have re-fired the VPE-port resize on no-change reinits.
- **Reinit log shows precrop.** `> Reinit: VIF+VPE reconfigure %ux%u
  -> %ux%u (precrop %ux%u+%u+%u)` so an operator can tell whether the
  trigger was a resolution change, an AR change, or a keepAspect toggle.
- **HTTP API contract bumped to 0.6.2.** `isp.keepAspect` field added to
  `/api/v1/config`, `/api/v1/set` accepts both snake_case and the
  Majestic-style camelCase alias.
- **WebUI dashboard exposes the toggle** under the ISP section; embedded
  gzip regenerated via `make webui`.  Also drops the stale `isp.exposure`
  entry that lingered after the field was removed in 0.7.0.
- **Active precrop visible via API.** New
  `venc_api_set_active_precrop()` / `venc_api_get_active_precrop()` are
  called from the Star6E pipeline whenever VIF is (re)programmed.
  `/api/v1/config` gains a `runtime.active_precrop` block alongside the
  config; Star6E `/api/v1/ae` includes the same rect under
  `data.runtime.active_precrop`.  Maruko reports nothing until it gains
  precrop support.  Useful for confirming a `keepAspect` toggle landed
  without grepping the log.
- **Unit tests.** New `compute_precrop` cases cover both `keep_aspect`
  values plus the 2-pixel alignment guarantee, and a new
  `test_active_precrop_setter` exercises the venc_api setter/getter
  including the cleared-store, overwrite, and NULL-out-pointer paths
  (1180 tests, was 1139).

## [0.7.8] - 2026-04-18

Pre-merge review fixes folded in (see PR-47 review notes):

- **Atomic config write.** `venc_config_save()` now writes to `<path>.tmp`,
  fsyncs the file, renames over the target, and fsyncs the containing
  directory.  Power cut mid-write (a real failure mode on FPV hardware)
  no longer truncates `/etc/venc.json` — you always get either the old
  or the new copy, never a partial.
- **Flash-write guard.** `venc_api_save_config_to_disk()` caches the
  last successfully-saved VencConfig and skips the write when the
  candidate is byte-identical.  Hot loops (adaptive-link re-asserting
  the same kbps, WebUI sliders landing on their current value) no
  longer wear flash.
- **Save errors surface.** `venc_config_save()` return value is now
  honored.  `/api/v1/defaults` response gains `"saved":bool`.  LIVE /
  RESTART `/api/v1/set` paths log a `WARNING: config save to X failed
  — in-memory change committed but on-disk copy is stale` to stderr so
  operators catch disk-full / readonly-FS conditions from the venc log.
- **SDK call return values logged.** `MI_SNR_SetOrien`,
  `MI_VPE_SetChannelParam` (reinit), and `MI_SNR_SetFps` (reinit) now
  log non-zero returns so BSP regressions surface instead of silently
  leaving the image upside-down or the sensor stuck at the wrong FPS.
- **Dashboard source tracked.** HTML authored in `web/dashboard.html`;
  `tools/build_webui.py` regenerates the embedded gzip deterministically
  (mtime=0, compresslevel=9).  New `make webui` and `make webui-check`
  targets; `make verify` runs `webui-check` to catch drift.

- **WebUI reinit + IDR fixes.** Four related bugs in the reinit/save
  path and one missing IDR-on-bitrate behaviour.
- **Fix #1 — FPS kick on live reinit.** `star6e_pipeline_reinit`
  (`src/star6e_pipeline.c`) now re-kicks `MI_SNR_SetFps` at the end so
  a live FPS change actually reconfigures sensor timing.  Previously
  the kick only fired during the initial `star6e_pipeline_start_vpe`
  legacyAe branch and the once-per-process CUS3A `fps_kick_done`
  gate — neither re-armed on reinit, so the sensor stayed stuck at
  its cold-boot timing (e.g. 100 fps when 120 was requested).
- **Fix #2 — Save & Restart actually saves.** Added
  `venc_api_set_config_path()` (called by star6e_runtime and
  maruko_runtime with `VENC_CONFIG_DEFAULT_PATH`).  Both LIVE
  (`apply_live_set_query`) and RESTART (`process_restart_set_query`)
  set paths now call `venc_config_save()` before returning, so every
  `/api/v1/set` round-trip persists to `/etc/venc.json`.  `handle_restart`
  is intentionally left pure (reload-from-disk only, matching SIGHUP);
  the per-set save takes care of persistence so the WebUI "Save &
  Restart" flow ends with the on-disk copy already matching memory.
  Bonus: manual file swaps (e.g. scp of a config backup) followed by
  `/api/v1/restart` reload exactly what was written.
- **Fix #3 — Restore Defaults actually restores.** New
  `GET /api/v1/defaults` endpoint (`handle_defaults`) writes
  compiled-in defaults to disk and triggers reinit.  WebUI JS
  `restoreDefaults()` rewired from `/api/v1/restart` to the new
  endpoint (embedded gzip regenerated).  Previously the button just
  reloaded the on-disk config — misleading, and did nothing if the
  file already matched in-memory state.
- **Fix #5 — IDR on bitrate change.** `apply_bitrate` in both
  `src/star6e_controls.c` and `src/maruko_controls.c` now issues
  `MI_VENC_RequestIdr` after `MI_VENC_SetChnAttr`, gated through the
  existing `idr_rate_limit_allow` so storm callers stay coalesced.
  The decoder now gets a fresh keyframe to resync against the new
  rate-control state instead of drifting on stale P-frames.
- **Fix #4 — image.mirror / image.flip** now re-apply on reinit.
  `MI_VPE_SetChannelParam` is only invoked during VPE creation inside
  `star6e_pipeline_start_vpe`; the non-aspect-ratio reinit path skipped
  VPE rebuild, so a mirror/flip toggle would persist to disk and log
  "Pipeline reinit complete" but never actually change the output.
  Added an unconditional `MI_VPE_SetChannelParam(0, ...)` at the end
  of `star6e_pipeline_reinit` carrying the current mirror/flip/3DNR
  params.  Config round-trip verified on 192.168.1.13; visual flip
  verification requires a live decoder (operator check).

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-18

- **Perf-series PR-C.1 — port MI_VENC_GetFd + poll() blocking wait to
  the Maruko main encoder loop.** Follow-up to PR-C (Star6E dual_rec
  only).  Maruko's main encoder loop in `maruko_pipeline_run`
  (`src/maruko_pipeline.c:1291`) was spinning on `maruko_mi_venc_query
  + usleep(500)` — ~2000 syscalls/s during idle gaps.  Replaced with
  `poll(MI_VENC_GetFd, 1000 ms)` and a wall-clock idle-abort timer
  (20 s of no frames → abort, preserved from the original
  `idle_counter * 500us` logic).
- **Fallback preserved:** if `MI_VENC_GetFd` returns < 0 on an unknown
  BSP variant, the loop falls back to the original Query+usleep(500)
  spin.  POLLERR/POLLHUP/POLLNVAL on the fd path drops into the
  fallback for the rest of the run.
- **Lifecycle:** `MI_VENC_CloseFd` called at cleanup when the fd was
  acquired.  The fd function pointers were already loaded by
  `maruko_mi.c` (dlsym'd but unused before this PR).
- **New bindings** (`include/maruko_bindings.h`): `maruko_mi_venc_get_fd`
  and `maruko_mi_venc_close_fd` macros alongside the existing
  MI_VENC_* wrappers.
- **Wall-clock idle timeout** consolidates the old dual idle paths
  (500us-keyed counter) into a single `wb_monotonic_us()`-based
  deadline that works identically on both the fd path (rare wakeups)
  and the fallback spin path (frequent wakeups).

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-18

- **Perf-series PR-C — dual_rec_thread blocking wait via MI_VENC_GetFd.**
  Third of the 2026-04-18 perf series.  Replaces the 1-ms `usleep` spin
  in the dual-recorder thread with a `poll()` on the VENC channel's
  kernel fd (`MI_VENC_GetFd`).  The fd signals `POLLIN` when a frame is
  ready, so the thread wakes once per frame (~120/s at 120 fps) instead
  of ~1000/s from the old 1 ms spin — ~88 % fewer syscalls during
  recording.
- **Fallback preserved:** if `MI_VENC_GetFd` returns < 0 on an unknown
  BSP variant, the thread falls back to the original
  `MI_VENC_Query + usleep(1000)` loop — zero behaviour change on SDKs
  that don't expose the fd.
- **Lifecycle:** `MI_VENC_CloseFd` is called on thread exit when the fd
  was acquired.  The fd function pointers were already loaded by
  `star6e_mi.c` / `maruko_mi.c` (dlsym'd but unused before this PR).

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-18

- **Perf-series PR-B — IDR request rate-limit gate.** Second of the
  2026-04-18 perf series.  Addresses the latent stability hazard where
  five independent IDR producers (scene detector, HTTP `/request/idr`
  and `/api/v1/dual/idr`, controls-apply, recorder-start) could storm
  `MI_VENC_RequestIdr` without coordination — a bug-driven burst
  (mis-tuned scene threshold during a camera pan) can crater per-frame
  bitrate by chaining forced keyframes.
- **New module (`include/idr_rate_limit.h`, `src/idr_rate_limit.c`):**
  per-channel (up to 8) last-honored timestamp + honored/dropped
  counters.  `idr_rate_limit_allow(chn)` enforces a compile-time
  `IDR_RATE_LIMIT_MIN_SPACING_US` of 100 ms — at 120 fps that is 12
  frames between honored forced IDRs, well below the GOP period
  (~83 ms at GOP=10, which auto-inserts an IDR without RequestIdr).
  State is lock-free (`__atomic_` load/store on `uint64_t`/`uint32_t`).
- **Wired through the 5 producer sites:**
  - `src/star6e_runtime.c` — `star6e_scene_request_idr`,
    `runtime_request_idr`
  - `src/star6e_controls.c` — `request_idr` (backend callback for HTTP
    `/request/idr`)
  - `src/venc_api.c` — `handle_dual_idr` (HTTP `/api/v1/dual/idr`);
    coalesced response returns `{"coalesced":true}`
  - `src/maruko_pipeline.c` — `maruko_scene_request_idr`
  - `src/maruko_controls.c` — `apply_qp_delta` IDR reissue
- **New endpoint `GET /api/v1/idr/stats`** returns per-channel honored
  and dropped counts plus the configured `min_spacing_us`.  Used by
  `tools/idr_storm.sh` to validate the gate.
- **Unit tests (`tests/test_idr_rate_limit.c`, 20 cases):** first-call
  honored, burst coalescing, per-channel independence, out-of-range
  bypass, post-spacing honored, reset semantics.  1139 tests pass
  (up from 1119).

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-18

- **Perf-series PR-A — clock wrapper + dual_rec Query dedup + bench infra.**
  First of a five-PR series landing the post-review performance findings
  from 2026-04-18 (see `bench/perf-series/README.md`).
- **Clock reads via vDSO (`include/timing.h`, `src/timing.c`):** New
  `wb_monotonic_us()` helper using `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (vDSO fast path on
  ARMv7, ~100 ns/call) instead of `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` (real syscall,
  ~1500 ns/call on A7).  Replaces three duplicated local wrappers —
  `monotonic_us` in `star6e_video.c` and `maruko_pipeline.c`, and
  `now_us` in `rtp_sidecar.c`.  NTP slew is <500 ppm → <4 us drift over
  a 60 s bench window, well inside frame-timing measurement error.
- **dual_rec backpressure signal (`src/star6e_runtime.c`):** Replaced the
  post-`MI_VENC_ReleaseStream` peek `MI_VENC_Query` with an inspection of
  the pre-`GetStream` `stat.curPacks >= 2` condition.  Equivalent
  semantics (queue had a backlog before we consumed) at one fewer syscall
  per recorded frame (~120/s at 120 fps).
- **Perf-series bench harness (`bench/perf-series/`):** New
  `run_bench.sh` drives the Tier A/B/C bench recipe end-to-end (deploy,
  probe, collect); `compare.py` emits a markdown Delta table between two
  labels with a 1.5×sigma regression flag.  Baseline tag
  `perf-series-baseline` pinned at master `40b8435`.
- **Host microbench (`tools/clock_bench.c`):** 1 M-iteration loop over
  `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE` to
  validate the vDSO assumption on A7 before deploying the PR.
- **IDR-storm stress (`tools/idr_storm.sh`):** Infrastructure for PR-B
  validation; fires N `POST /api/v1/dual/idr` back-to-back and reports
  the honored:fired ratio.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-14

- **Star6E sidecar gate (parity with Maruko PR #37):** Gated the per-frame
  `rtp_sidecar_poll` / `monotonic_us` / `rtp_sidecar_send_frame` work in
  `star6e_video_send_frame` on `state->sidecar.fd >= 0`.  When the
  sidecar feature is disabled (port 0), these calls are now skipped
  entirely rather than relying on each callee's early return.
- **SHM write: iovec-style 3-segment ring put (`venc_ring.h`, both backends):**
  Added `venc_ring_write3(hdr, p1, p2)` so the producer no longer has to
  pre-flatten `payload1 + payload2` into an 8 KB `flat[]` stack buffer
  before calling `venc_ring_write`.  Drops one memcpy per fragmented RTP
  packet (H.265 FU), removes the 8 KB stack allocation, and eliminates
  the `RTP_BUFFER_MAX` size clamp on the SHM write path.
  Applied to `src/star6e_output.c::star6e_output_send_rtp_parts` and
  `src/maruko_video.c::maruko_video_send_rtp_parts`.
  `venc_ring_write` is preserved as a thin wrapper for existing callers
  (C and C++, including the wfb_tx patched consumer).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-12

- **Phase 5 — Maruko HEVC RTP parity (PR #32):** Extracted the HEVC RTP
  output stage into a shared `hevc_rtp` module (`include/hevc_rtp.h` +
  `src/hevc_rtp.c`). Both Star6E and Maruko now go through the same
  Aggregation Packet (type 48) builder, FU-A fragmentation, VPS/SPS/PPS
  prepend-on-IDR, and per-frame `HevcRtpStats`. `star6e_hevc_rtp.c` is
  now a thin stream-iteration wrapper (227 lines → 111 lines);
  `Star6eHevcRtpStats` becomes a typedef alias of `HevcRtpStats` so
  existing call sites are unchanged. Maruko's RTP output gets standards-
  compliant AP aggregation for the first time: hardware-validated on
  SSC378QE at H.265 CBR 118 fps / 8 Mbps — IDR frames pack
  VPS+SPS+PPS+IDR as a single AP packet (`ap 1/6` in `[pktzr]` verbose
  line) instead of 4 separate RTP datagrams.
- **`[pktzr]` verbose line on Maruko:** Matches Star6E's exact format
  (`nals N | rtp N | fill N B | single N | ap N/N | fu N`) so log
  tooling works across both backends.
- **H.264 RTP output removed from Maruko:** Maruko ships H.265-only on
  the RTP wire path. The H.264 path was never hardware-verified and
  Maruko's FPV use case is H.265 exclusive. Channel creation still
  accepts `codec=h264` for forward compatibility, but the frame sender
  emits a warning and drops output. Net -~130 lines in `maruko_video.c`.
- **New `test_hevc_rtp` suite** (3 tests, 16 assertions): AP packing of
  small NALs, AP→FU-A fallback on oversized NALs, VPS/SPS/PPS prepend
  behavior — uses a capture-callback harness (no sockets) so tests run
  in <1 ms. Existing Star6E AP/FU-A test still passes unchanged as
  regression guard.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-11

- **dlopen migration (both backends):** Both Star6E and Maruko now load all
  MI vendor libraries (SYS, VIF, VPE, VENC, ISP, SCL, SNR) at runtime via
  dlopen/dlsym instead of direct linking. Function pointers are dispatched
  through `_impl` structs (`g_mi_sys`, `g_mi_vif`, etc.) with macro wrappers
  so call sites are unchanged. Three-way preprocessor guards
  (`PLATFORM_STAR6E` / `PLATFORM_MARUKO` / test stubs) keep all paths clean.
  - Star6E: dependency-ordered loading (cam_os_wrapper → SYS → ISP/CUS3A
    with RTLD_LAZY for circular deps → VIF/VPE/SNR/VENC with RTLD_NOW).
  - Maruko: eliminated uClibc shim and 3+ MB of redundant libs on device.
  - New files: `star6e_mi.h/.c`, `maruko_mi.h/.c`.
  - Removed: `-lmi_*` link flags, `MARUKO_UCLIBC_DIR`, shim build rules.
- **Maruko IQ parameter system:** Full 60-parameter ISP image quality API
  for Maruko (Phase 2), matching Star6E's existing IQ support. Includes
  multi-field struct params (colortrans, r2y, OBC, etc.), dot-notation
  set, and export/import. New files: `maruko_iq.h/.c`.
- **Maruko sensor mode diagnostics:** Auto-cap exposure to sensor FPS
  for reliable 120fps cold-boot. Fix SCL clock configuration. Gain
  control and exposure callback improvements.
- **Disable AF in CUS3A:** Fixed-focus cameras (IMX415) no longer trigger
  AF motor init errors. All CUS3A enable sequences changed from
  `{1,1,1}` (AE+AWB+AF) to `{1,1,0}` (AE+AWB only). Post-override
  after EnableUserspace3A which internally re-enables AF.
- **Star6E VPE exit(127) fix:** Under dlopen, vendor MI_VPE_DisablePort
  calls exit(127) on non-existent channel. Fixed by probing channel
  with MI_VPE_GetChannelAttr before VPE teardown.
- **Bool cast safety:** MI_SNR_GetPlaneMode vendor function writes 4 bytes
  through a `_Bool*` pointer. Fixed with temp-int wrappers on both backends.
- **Known issues documented:** Maruko encoder stall after output
  disable/re-enable (`documentation/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`).
- **Build cleanup:** Removed dead `snr_toggle_test` and `snr_sequence_probe`
  build recipes (unbuildable without direct MI linking). Removed stale
  uClibc references from deploy scripts and docs.
- Added `sensors-src` submodule pointing to OpenIPC/sensors for sensor
  driver source reference.
- Added IMX335 IQ profile (`iq-profiles/imx335_greg_fpvVII-gpt200.json`).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-03

- Fix cold-boot 54fps lock with legacyAe: call MI_SNR_SetFps during
  pipeline startup to force sensor timing compliance when CUS3A is not
  active.
- Fix sidecar telemetry NULL pointer: enriched encoder feedback was
  never sent (enc_ptr was NULL instead of &enc_info).
- Scene detector: saturate frame_count to prevent EMA warmup re-entry
  after ~13h; cache frame_size/type to avoid redundant packet walks;
  skip spike logic entirely when disabled (threshold=0).
- Change video0.scene_threshold and scene_holdoff to MUT_RESTART
  (no live-apply pathway exists).
- Remove all enc_ctrl/encCtrl references from code and documentation.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-02

- Add inline scene detector in star6e_runtime.c (~150 lines) behind
  `video0.scene_threshold` config field.
  - Tracks frame size EMA, computes complexity (0-255).
  - Detects spikes above configurable threshold for holdoff consecutive frames.
  - Waits for spike to subside before requesting IDR (when threshold>0).
  - Two config fields: `video0.scene_threshold` (uint16, 0=off, 150=1.5x EMA
    spike detection), `video0.scene_holdoff` (uint8, default 2).
  - Default off (`scene_threshold=0`): no IDR injection — zero-risk default.
- Enrich RTP timing sidecar with per-frame encoder telemetry:
  `frame_type`, `complexity`, `scene_change`, `idr_inserted`,
  `frames_since_idr`.
- Add multi-field set to HTTP API: `GET /api/v1/set?a=1&b=2` applies
  multiple live fields atomically in one request.
- Add field capabilities endpoint with backend-specific support filtering:
  `GET /api/v1/capabilities` reports mutability and per-backend support.
- API improvements: camelCase alias table for Majestic-compatible clients,
  duplicate-field rejection in multi-set, mixed live/restart rejection.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-01

- Add debug OSD overlay for encoder diagnostics and EIS crop visualization.
  Disabled by default (`debug.showOsd`), zero runtime cost when off.
  - MI_RGN canvas overlay via dlopen — ARGB4444 pixel format, full-frame canvas
    with dirty-rect tracking (only clears/draws changed areas per frame).
  - Stats panel (top-left): fps counter, CPU% from /proc/stat, 3x scaled 8x8
    bitmap font with semi-transparent background.
  - EIS crop visualization (bottom-right): 1/3 scale miniature showing sensor
    area (white), margin boundary (yellow), and moving crop window (green fill).
  - NEON-accelerated row fill (vst1q_u16, 8 pixels per store, 2.4x vs naive).
  - Mutually exclusive with waybeam-hub `mod_osd_render` — both use MI_RGN
    global state on VPE channel 0.
  - Config: `"debug": { "showOsd": true }`, API: `debug.show_osd` (MUT_RESTART).
  - New files: `include/debug_osd.h`, `src/debug_osd.c`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-27

- Fix IMU webui fields invisible: rename config keys `sampleRate` →
  `sampleRateHz`, `gyroRange` → `gyroRangeDps` to match dashboard SECTIONS.
- Add 5 missing default config keys: `eis.mode`, `record.bitrate`,
  `record.fps`, `record.gopSize`, `record.server`.
- Fix camelCase capabilities lookup for `swapXY` and `maxMB` in webui.
- Remove legacy `sendFeedback` outgoing config alias.
- Document config/webui/API four-layer sync rules in AGENTS.md.
- Fix cold-boot sensor framerate lock: poll ISP exposure limits up to 500 ms
  instead of skipping the shutter cap when struct is all-zero. Apply synthetic
  gain defaults as fallback so AE cannot converge on exposure > frame period.
- Add IQ enable/disable toggle: virtual `.enabled` field for non-bool params
  (e.g. `colortrans.enabled=0`). Import respects `enabled` JSON field.
  Dashboard shows toggle switch in expanded form for applicable params.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-22

- Add built-in web dashboard at `/` with Settings, API Reference, and
  Image Quality tabs. Served as pre-compressed gzip (14KB on the wire).
- Add multi-field IQ parameter descriptors: colortrans (3 offsets + 3x3
  matrix), r2y, obc, demosaic, false_color, crosstalk, wdr_curve_adv now
  expose all sub-fields via dot-notation set API and `"fields"` JSON object.
- Add IQ export/import: `GET /api/v1/iq` exports all 62 ISP params as JSON,
  `POST /api/v1/iq/import` restores them. Partial imports supported.
- Add all missing config sections to the API: record (including dual channel
  bitrate/fps/gopSize/server), EIS (12 params), IMU (7 params), full audio
  (6 params), and ISP extras (legacyAe, aeFps). Total: 75 controllable fields.
- Add FT_FLOAT field type for EIS float params with `%.6g` precision to
  prevent artifacts like `0.001` displaying as `0.0010000000474974513`.
- Add FT_UINT8 field type for `imu.i2c_addr` — fixes memory corruption where
  `FT_UINT` wrote 4 bytes to a 1-byte field.
- Consolidate frame-loss threshold into shared function with minimum 512 kbit/s
  absolute margin for low-bitrate streams and 200 Mbps overflow clamp.
- Add `g_iq_mutex` for thread-safe IQ query/set operations.
- Add `g_dual_mutex` for thread-safe dual channel HTTP handlers.
- Fix `#ifdef` to `#if HAVE_BACKEND_STAR6E` in dual_apply_bitrate (Maruko
  link error from upstream PR #18).
- Fix stream_packs memory leak in SIGHUP reinit path.
- Fix diagnostic JSON trailing comma when dlsym lookups partially resolve.
- Add snprintf overflow protection (`JSON_CLAMP` macro) in IQ query output.
- Add EINTR handling in httpd read loops.
- Move dual channel settings from raw JSON file parsing to VencConfigRecord
  struct fields, simplifying star6e_runtime.c.
- Increase HTTPD_MAX_ROUTES to 64, HTTPD_MAX_BODY to 8192.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-22

- Refresh the Star6E frame-loss threshold on live bitrate changes so
  `/api/v1/set?video0.bitrate=...` keeps frame dropping aligned with the
  updated main-channel bitrate.
- Refresh the Star6E dual-channel frame-loss threshold on
  `/api/v1/dual/set?bitrate=...` so ch1 live bitrate changes keep the same
  overflow protection policy as channel creation.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-18

- Add Opus audio codec via `libopus.so` (loaded at runtime; graceful fallback
  to PCM if absent). RTP payload type PT=120, 48kHz nominal clock per RFC 7587.
- Fix 48kHz audio on SSC338Q — three root causes:
  - I2S clock misconfiguration: `i2s.clock` must be `0` (MCLK disabled; I2S
    master generates clock from internal PLL). Setting clock=1 caused hardware
    to deliver 16kHz data regardless of `rate` field. Source: SDK reference
    `audio_all_test_case.c` which uses `eMclk=0, bSyncClock=TRUE`.
  - Ring buffer too small: `AUDIO_RING_PCM_MAX` was 1280 (16kHz stereo
    headroom). 48kHz mono frames are 1920 bytes; silent truncation produced
    invalid Opus frame sizes → `OPUS_BAD_ARG`. Increased to 3840 (48kHz
    stereo 20ms = 960×2×2).
  - `bSyncClock` was 0; set to 1 per SDK reference.
- Fix stdout filter not active on SIGHUP reinit: `stdout_filter_start()` was
  inside `start_ai_capture()` which is skipped when AI device persists across
  reinit. Moved to `star6e_audio_init()` to run on every init cycle.
- Fix `stdout_filter_stop()` ordering: `close(pipe_read)` moved after
  `pthread_join` to avoid closing the fd while the filter thread may still
  be reading from it.
- Add `stdout_filter_stop()` to fail path and libmi_ai unavailable early-return
  to prevent filter leaks on audio init failure.
- Remove dead `star6e_audio_clock_for_rate()` function.
- Increase DMA ring: `frmNum` 8→20 (400ms), prevents data loss under ISP/AE
  preemption bursts.
- Reduce output port depth to `user=1, buf=2` (was 2,4), saving ~40ms latency.
- Audio init survives SIGHUP reinit: AI device/channel state is persisted in
  `g_ai_persist` across reinit cycles to avoid `CamOsMutexLock` deadlock after
  2+ VPE create/destroy cycles.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-17
- Fix SIGHUP reinit D-state: switch from full pipeline_stop/start to partial
  teardown that keeps sensor/VIF/VPE running. The SigmaStar MIPI PHY does not
  recover from MI_SNR_Disable/Enable cycles — partial teardown avoids touching
  it entirely. VENC, output, audio, IMU/EIS are torn down and rebuilt; the
  VIF→VPE REALTIME bind stays active across reinit.
- Live resolution switching: `video0.size` API change now reconfigures the
  pipeline in-process without a process restart.
  - Same-aspect-ratio changes (e.g. 1920x1080 → 1280x720): VPE output port
    resize only — VIF and VIF→VPE bind are untouched.
  - Aspect-ratio changes (e.g. 1920x1080 → 1920x1440): full VIF crop
    reconfiguration + VPE destroy/recreate. VIF device stays running;
    MIPI PHY is never touched.
  - Overscan correction applied during reinit precrop: uses `mode.output`
    (usable area) rather than `plane.capt` (raw MIPI frame) for sensors that
    report overscan in the MIPI frame dimensions.
- Guard VIF→VPE bind in `bind_and_finalize_pipeline` to prevent double-bind
  on reinit. Without the guard, re-binding an already-live VIF→VPE port
  caused continuous `IspApiGet channel not created` dmesg errors.
- ISP channel readiness poll (`star6e_pipeline_wait_isp_channel`) called
  immediately after every new VIF→VPE bind. The ISP channel initialises
  asynchronously after `MI_VPE_CreateChannel`; the poll (up to 2000 ms,
  1 ms intervals) ensures the ISP is ready before the bin load and exposure
  cap APIs probe it, eliminating `IspApiGet` dmesg errors on both cold boot
  and AR-change reinit.
- `__attribute__((flatten))` on `star6e_pipeline_reinit`: forces GCC -Os to
  inline all static callees, preserving the stack layout that the SigmaStar
  ISP driver requires for `MI_VPE_CreateChannel` to succeed.
- Error-path state consistency in VIF+VPE reconfiguration: on failure after
  VPE is destroyed, `MI_VIF_DisableDev` is called to leave the pipeline in a
  cleanly-stopped state rather than a partially-configured one.
- Details: `documentation/SIGHUP_REINIT.md`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-16
- Reduce G.711 audio latency: scale frame size to `sample_rate/50` (~20ms)
  instead of hardcoded 320. Reduce MI_AI ring (frmNum 16→8), output port
  depth (4,16)→(2,4), fnGetFrame timeout 100→50ms.
- Add dynamic RTP payload types: PT=112 (PCMU non-8kHz), PT=113 (PCMA
  non-8kHz). Standard PTs (0, 8, 11) still used when rate matches RFC 3551.
- Clamp audio sample_rate to 8000-48000 in config parser.
- Default audio codec changed from `pcm` to `g711a` in venc.default.json.
- Remove `slicesEnabled`/`sliceSize`/`lowDelay` config fields (no firmware support on I6E).
- Add `frameLost` config field for frame-lost strategy (default: true).
- Fix kbps verbose overflow on 32-bit ARM (displayed ~400 instead of ~13000 at high bitrates).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-15
- Custom 3A thread for Star6E — replaces ISP internal AE/AWB with a
  dedicated 15 Hz thread (default, no config change needed):
  - AE: proportional controller with shutter-first priority, configurable
    target luma (100-140), convergence rate (10%), and gain ceiling (20x).
  - AWB: grey-world algorithm with IIR smoothing (70/30) and 2% dead-band.
  - Pauses ISP AE via `MI_ISP_AE_SetState(PAUSE)`, disables CUS3A AWB
    callback via `MI_ISP_CUS3A_Enable(1,0,0)`.
  - Periodic ISP AE state verification with automatic re-pause.
  - Manual AWB (`ct_manual`) pauses custom AWB; `auto` resumes it.
  - `isp.exposure` API syncs max shutter to the custom AE thread.
  - Set `isp.legacyAe: true` to revert to old ISP AE + handoff behavior.
- New config fields: `aeFps`, `legacyAe` in the `isp` section.
  Gain/shutter limits now seeded from ISP bin (`MI_ISP_AE_GetExposureLimit`).
- HW verified: all 4 imx335 sensor modes (30/60/90/120fps), cold-boot,
  live FPS switching, gemini dual recording, manual AWB transitions.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-14
- Restored working Star6E AE across IMX335 modes `30`, `60`, `90`, and `120 fps`:
  - Startup now primes CUS3A with `100 -> 110 -> 111`.
  - Steady state no longer forces periodic `110` refreshes.
  - A delayed one-shot `000` handoff returns the pipeline to a live AE state
    while preserving the requested encoder rate.
- Added Star6E AE diagnostics for live verification:
  - `GET /api/v1/ae`
  - `GET /metrics/isp`
  - Existing `GET /api/v1/awb` remains available for AWB inspection.
- Documented the verified AE recovery and updated the HTTP API contract for
  the diagnostics endpoints.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-11
- Fixed GOP keyframe interval to be relative to FPS (seconds, not raw frames):
  - `gopSize` is now a float representing seconds between keyframes.
  - `1.0` = 1 keyframe/second (GOP = fps frames). `0.5` = every 0.5s. `0` = all-intra.
  - Example: `gopSize: 0.33` at 90fps = keyframe every ~30 frames.
  - Changing FPS now automatically recalculates GOP frame count.
  - Default changed from `3` (frames) to `1.0` (seconds).
- Fixed autoexposure not restoring via HTTP API:
  - Setting `isp.exposure=0` via API now correctly restores auto-exposure
    (caps max shutter to frame period). Previously it was a no-op due to
    both args being zero in `cap_exposure_for_fps(0, 0)`.
- Known issue: AWB (Auto White Balance) behavior unverified on device.
  - CUS3A enables AWB (`params[1]=1`) but actual color correction depends on
    ISP bin calibration data. Requires on-device testing. See
    `documentation/AWB_INVESTIGATION.md`.
- Known issue: ROI QP not yet wired to encoder backend.
  - Config plumbing and HTTP API exist but `apply_roi_qp` callback is NULL.
  - SDK supports overlapping ROI regions with delta QP via
    `MI_VENC_SetRoiCfg`. Implemented as horizontal bands with signed QP
    (1-4 steps). See `documentation/ROI_INVESTIGATION.md`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-10
- Added audio output via UDP with configurable codec and port:
  - Supported codecs: raw PCM, G.711 A-law, G.711 μ-law (software encoding).
  - Audio captured via MI_AI SDK (dlopen at runtime, graceful degradation if unavailable).
  - New `audio` config section: `enabled`, `sampleRate`, `channels`, `codec`, `volume`, `mute`.
  - New `outgoing.audioPort` field: 0 = share video port, >0 = dedicated audio port (default 5601).
  - Audio runs in a separate thread from the video streaming loop.
  - Dual packetization: compact mode (0xAA magic header) and RTP mode (PT 110, distinct SSRC).
  - Live mute/unmute via HTTP API (`audio.mute`, MUT_LIVE).
  - Star6E backend: full implementation. Maruko backend: warning stub.
- RTP mode now reads `maxPayloadSize` from config (was hardcoded to 1200):
  - Both star6e and maruko backends respect `outgoing.maxPayloadSize` for
    RTP FU-A/FU fragmentation threshold. Default 1400.
  - Config values above 1400 are supported for jumbo-frame networks.
- Added adaptive RTP payload sizing to reduce CPU churn from packet overhead:
  - EWMA tracks average P-frame size; IDR-like spikes (>3x average) are
    excluded to prevent distortion.
  - Target payload = avg_frame * fps / targetPacketRate, aiming for ~850
    packets/sec by default across all bitrates (adaptive bitrate up to 50 Mbit).
  - `outgoing.targetPacketRate` config field (default 850, MUT_RESTART).
    Set to 0 to disable adaptive sizing and use fixed maxPayloadSize.
  - 15% hysteresis prevents oscillation on frame-to-frame jitter.
  - Payload clamped to [1000, maxPayloadSize]. The 1000-byte floor keeps
    packet rate under ~500 pkt/s on low-MCS WiFi links (MCS0 slot budget).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10
- Added output enable/disable control (`outgoing.enabled`, MUT_LIVE):
  - When disabled: FPS reduces to 5fps idle rate, frames encoded and discarded.
  - When enabled: FPS restores to previous value, IDR keyframe issued.
  - Default: `false` (no more implicit localhost:5000 fallback).
- Added live destination redirect (`outgoing.server`, MUT_LIVE):
  - Change UDP destination without pipeline restart.
  - IDR keyframe issued on destination change for stream continuity.
  - Re-connects UDP socket when `connectedUdp` is enabled.
- Added stream mode config field (`outgoing.streamMode`, MUT_RESTART):
  - Values: `"rtp"` (default) or `"compact"`.
  - Replaces scheme-derived mode detection; URI scheme must be `udp://`.
- Added connected UDP (`outgoing.connectedUdp`, MUT_RESTART):
  - When true: `connect()` called on UDP socket, skips per-packet routing
    lookup and enables kernel ICMP error feedback.
- Added IDR request after live bitrate change for immediate quality update.
- Updated HTTP API contract to v0.2.0.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-26
- Fixed ISP FIFO stall on overscan sensor modes (imx335 mode 2 @ 90fps):
  - Added periodic CUS3A refresh (~15 Hz) in stream loop to keep ISP event
    loop alive; runs in both idle and active paths so a stalled pipeline
    can recover.
  - Fixed overscan detection: removed 10% threshold that skipped correction
    for single-axis overscan (imx335 mode 2: crop 2560x1440, output 2400x1350).
    Changed to per-axis independent clamping.
- Simplified ISP 3A management (Star6E + Maruko):
  - Replaced per-frame AE cadence toggling and ISP3AHandle/ISP3AState machinery
    with one-shot `enable_cus3a()` at pipeline init + periodic `cus3a_tick()`.
  - Removed CLI flags: `--ae-on/off`, `--awb-on/off`, `--af-on/off`, `--ae-cadence`.
- Added ISP/SCL clock boost (384 MHz) after pipeline setup.
- Added `--oc-level` for hardware overclocking:
  - Level 1: VENC clock boost to 480 MHz.
  - Level 2: Level 1 + CPU pinned to 1200 MHz with performance governor.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-25
- Added AE cadence control (`--ae-cadence N`) for high-FPS throughput recovery:
  - Toggles CUS3A processing on/off every N frames to reduce per-frame CPU overhead.
  - Auto mode: when FPS >60, cadence defaults to fps/15 (e.g. cadence=8 at 120fps).
  - Manual override via `--ae-cadence N` for fine-tuning.
- Moved ISP bin load earlier in pipeline setup (after start_vpe, before streaming)
  to ensure correct ae_init state before first frame.
- Added overscan crop detection for sensor modes where mode.output < mode.crop:
  - When overscan exceeds 10% on both axes, VIF center-crops to the usable output area.
  - Fixes imx415 mode 1 hang (crop=2952x1656, output=2560x1440).
  - Threshold prevents false positives from driver metadata quirks.
- Enhanced `--list-sensor-modes` to show crop/output details when they differ.
- Cleaned up pipeline summary prints: explicit MIPI frame vs cropped dimensions,
  precrop line only shown for actual aspect-ratio cropping.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-25
- Improved agentic coding workflow in AGENTS.md:
  - Added structured error recovery loop (observe → diagnose → repair → re-verify → document).
  - Added incremental verification guidance: run `make lint` after each logical change.
  - Added long-session guidance: progress checkpoints, decision stability, scope control.
  - Added error diagnosis reference table for compiler, linker, runtime, and timeout failures.
  - Added deployment test interpretation: exit codes, JSON summary, dmesg guidance, agent decision flow.
  - Added "Mistakes to Avoid" entries for stacking unverified changes and mid-task approach switching.
- Added `make lint` target: fast compile-only check with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` for both backends.
- Added lint step to CI workflow (runs before build).
- Synced dual-agent infrastructure (Claude Code + OpenAI Codex):
  - Updated all `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/commands/` with decision documentation,
    error recovery loop, and incremental lint steps.
  - Added `Bash(make lint*)` to Claude permissions; switched PostToolUse hook
    from full build to fast lint for tighter feedback loop.
  - Enhanced `.codex/config.toml` with `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"`.
- Improved `remote_test.sh`:
  - Added SSH ControlMaster multiplexing for persistent connections.
  - Removed runtime lib deployment (libs already in `/usr/lib` on target).
  - Added `--json-summary`, `--skip-build`, `--skip-deploy` flags.
  - Added strict exit codes (0=success, 1=failed, 2=unresponsive, 124=timeout).
- Added `documentation/TARGET_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` design doc (deferred implementation).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-23
- Added automatic precrop for Star6E: when encode resolution has a different aspect ratio
  than the sensor mode, the VIF center-crops the sensor frame to match the target aspect
  ratio before the VPE scales, eliminating non-uniform scaling distortion.
- Precrop uses integer cross-multiplication (no floats) with 2-pixel alignment enforcement.
- Informational log line printed when precrop is active (e.g. `Precrop: 1920x1080 -> 1440x1080 (offset 240,0)`).
- Fixed high-FPS throttling when AE is disabled: caps exposure to frame period after ISP bin
  load, preventing default 10ms shutter from limiting 120fps mode to ~99fps.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-23
- Added duplicate-process guard: venc now detects and exits if another instance is already running.
- Added `--version` / `-v` flag to print version and backend name.
- Added `--verbose` flag to gate per-frame stats output (previously always printed).
- Removed obsolete HiSilicon/Goke `-v [Version]` hardware presets from Star6E backend and help text.
- Simplified sensor mode selection: prioritize FPS match over resolution fit in both backends.
- Fixed Star6E cleanup ordering: socket and ISP 3A handle now properly released on all exit paths.
- Added informational prints for FPS mismatch, resolution clamping, and VPE scaling.
- Embedded build-time version from VERSION file via Makefile (`VENC_VERSION`).
- Updated help text branding from "HiSilicon/Goke" to "SigmaStar".
- Added crash/hang tracking policy and initial crash log (`documentation/CRASH_LOG.md`).
- Added SigmaStar Pudding SDK API reference link to proc reference and documentation index.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-22
- Added low-risk ISP CPU-control knobs in both standalone backends:
  - `--ae-off/--ae-on`
  - `--awb-off/--awb-on`
  - `--af-off/--af-on` (default AF off)
  - `--vpe-3dnr 0..7`
- Updated ISP bin load/reapply behavior to honor requested AE/AWB/AF state.
- Added documentation for CPU/latency tuning profiles and usage:
  - `documentation/AE_AWB_CPU_TUNING.md`
- Updated status/index docs to reflect implemented 3A/3DNR tuning controls.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-22
- Added formal HTTP API contract source-of-truth document:
  - `documentation/HTTP_API_CONTRACT.md`
- Added repository PR checklist template with explicit contract/version/doc gates:
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Added default JSON config template and planning artifacts for config/API migration:
  - `config/venc.default.json`
  - `documentation/CONFIG_HTTP_API_ROADMAP.md`
- Updated documentation/plan/process files to enforce:
  - Star6E-first rollout for SigmaStar API-touching features,
  - contract sync on HTTP changes,
  - SemVer + changelog workflow.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-22
- Baseline established for standalone-only repository scope.
- Targeted dual-backend builds in place (`SOC_BUILD=star6e`, `SOC_BUILD=maruko`).
- Runtime SoC autodetect removed from `venc`; backend is selected at build time.
- Default stream behavior aligned to RTP + H.265 CBR.
- Planning updates introduced for JSON config migration and HTTP control API roadmap.
