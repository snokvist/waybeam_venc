# VPE port1 luma tap + inline QR scanning

Status: **Built and device-verified** on the Star6E bench (imx335, 1080x1080
centre square). The tap is the capture side; `src/qr_scan.c` is the decode
side, shared with the `qr_decode` CLI. Results are in "Device results" below.

## Why this exists

The QR integration plan in `documentation/QR_INLINE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
captures through the MJPEG snapshot channel. Device measurement retired that
approach on three counts:

1. **The capture is OSD-contaminated by construction.** The MJPEG channel is a
   VPE **port0** 1:N consumer (`src/star6e_pipeline.c:2143-2158`). MI_RGN
   composites per output port, so every port0 consumer sees whatever overlay is
   attached. A snapshot pulled from a bench craft shows the waybeam-hub HUD
   composited dead centre of the frame — exactly where a marker would be placed
   — with `debug.showOsd` **false**, i.e. from the external hub. A QR scanner on
   port0 cannot see a marker the OSD covers.
2. **There is no capture-resolution control.** `snapshot.width`/`height` set the
   VENC channel's *maximum* encodable resolution, not a scaler. Measured: below
   the main stream every frame fails `_MI_VENC_ValidateResolution` and
   `/snapshot.jpg` returns `504` permanently; above it, the output is still the
   main-stream size. VENC has no scaler. A VPE port does.
3. **The JPEG round trip is pure overhead.** ~184 ms per attempt at 1080p to
   encode and re-decode pixels that already exist in DRAM as NV12.

## What this branch adds

A read-only luma tap on VPE port1: its own geometry, NV12, drained by a
dedicated reader thread for the duration of a scan window, with the Y plane
copied out only on request. A scan-window state machine whose supervisor thread
both owns the port and runs the decode. And the decode cascade itself, extracted
from `tools/qr/qr_decode.c` into `src/qr_scan.c` so the CLI and the daemon can
never drift apart.

## Device results

Bench: Star6E, imx335, 1920x1080 main stream, 1080x1080 tap centre square,
marker held in frame.

| | |
|---|---|
| decode, marker in view | **73-88 ms**, mean 81 ms over 100 windows, first frame of the first attempt, stage `sharp/full/refine` |
| worst case (no code, full cascade) | 431 ms @1080x1080, 238 ms @720x720, 117 ms @540x540 |
| peak cascade heap | 3.30x W*H (was 5.04x) |
| 100 open/decode/close cycles | 0 HTTP failures, 0 stuck windows, 0 kernel wedge signatures |
| daemon RSS across 100 cycles | 5968 -> 6088 KB (noise) |
| port1 arbitration | detect holds -> scan `409`; detect off -> qr claims -> stop -> detect reclaims |
| SIGHUP mid-cycle | clean reinit, port not stranded |
| MUT_RESTART reinit mid-window | clean, port not stranded |

The 1.5 s per-attempt figure carried over from the MJPEG path was wrong by an
order of magnitude for the common case: that estimate was a full cascade at
1920x1080 through a JPEG round trip, and a marker actually in view wins at the
very first stage on a cropped square.

## Design decisions

**Never cycle the port per request — but do scope it to a scan window.** The
`snapshot.pgm` retirement (#205) ran `SetPortMode → EnablePort → SetDepth →
GetBuf → PutBuf → SetDepth(0,0) → DisablePort` on *every HTTP request*, and the
`DisablePort` half raced an in-flight mhal buffer: 2 hard wedges in ~560 stressed
captures, kernel-side, not fixable from userspace.

The first cut of this module avoided that by holding the port for the whole
pipeline run. Measured on device, that is too expensive to keep: an always-on
1080p60 tap adds ~186 MB/s of SCL write traffic to shared DDR and cost 8-9
points of aggregate CPU while completely idle (45% → 54%, three samples each),
and it holds port1 against stab and detect for the entire run for no benefit
when nobody is scanning.

So the port is claimed and enabled for the duration of a **scan window** and
released at its end — orders of magnitude fewer Enable/Disable cycles than
per-request, but not zero. Bring-up only *arms* the tap
(`star6e_luma_tap_configure`); `star6e_luma_tap_open()` / `_close()` bracket a
window. Whether this is safe is an empirical question, not an argued one — see
Verification.

**A live close is not pipeline teardown.** Releasing the port while the encoder
keeps running is the risky ordering. `_close()` stops the reader and JOINs it
(the loop tests its run flag at the top, so it can only exit outside a
GetBuf/PutBuf pair), then **drains the port to quiescent** from the closing
thread, and only then resets depth and disables. Disabling while buffers are
still queued is precisely what races an in-flight mhal buffer. Pipeline teardown
(`_stop()`) is the same sequence plus disarming.

**The reader drains every frame; the consumer never does.** An
enabled-but-undrained port is dangerous on this BSP — the i6e port2 probe
stalled port0 with no consumer attached. The reader thread bounces every frame
(`GetBuf` → `PutBuf`, microseconds) and performs the Y-plane copy only when a
grab is pending. A future QR decode of ~1.5 s therefore never sits between
`GetBuf` and `PutBuf`.

**Teardown order is load-bearing:** stop the reader → join → drain to quiescent
→ `SetChnOutputPortDepth(0,0)` → `DisablePort` → release the arbiter claim.
Leaving the depth registered wedges the *next* process with a fence that never
completes. Every path that enabled the port — including failure unwinds — exits
through one teardown function.

**QR is the lowest-priority port1 claimant.** Stab and detect are unchanged.
`star6e_vpe_port1_claim("qr")` runs *after* both have had their turn, and a
refusal is logged and non-fatal. Deliberately not implemented: having QR
displace stab or detect automatically. The stab preset programs and enables its
tap before its (advisory, return-discarded) claim at
`src/star6e_pipeline.c:2117`, so making QR win would mean restructuring two
working, wedge-prone subsystems — unjustified on a branch whose purpose is to
find out whether the tap is safe. Operators turn stab/detect off to free port1.

**Geometry is configurable and independent of port0.** Proven by the existing
taps: detect runs 640×352 while port0 runs up to 2560×1440. `0` inherits the
main stream. The tap is what makes capture resolution a knob at all, and it is
the real memory lever for a future scanner — peak cascade heap scales with W×H,
so tapping at 1280×720 instead of 1920×1080 cuts it by 2.25×.

**Stride comes from the buffer descriptor, never assumed.** NV12 `u32Stride[0]`
with a width fallback. The PGM output is tightly packed and self-describing, so
a consumer reads real dimensions from the header.

**`MI_VPE_SetPortCrop` is never called.** It is sticky on i6e and a leftover
rect poisons a later detect run. The tap uses full-frame scaling only.

## Config

| JSON | API | Type | Default | Mut. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qr.tapEnabled` | `qr.tap_enabled` | bool | `false` | restart |
| `qr.tapWidth` | `qr.tap_width` | uint | `0` (inherit) | restart |
| `qr.tapHeight` | `qr.tap_height` | uint | `0` (inherit) | restart |

All `MUT_RESTART`: geometry is captured when the graph is configured, so a live
change would disagree with an open window. Fields carry `FIELD_UI` descriptors so the WebUI builds controls from
`/api/v1/capabilities` with no `SECTIONS[]` edit and no `make webui` rebuild.

## Endpoint

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/qr/tap/open` | claim port1 and enable the tap for a scan window. `409 port1_busy` when stab or detect holds it; `503 tap_disabled` when unarmed |
| `GET /api/v1/qr/tap.pgm` | one P5 frame at tap geometry. `503 tap_disabled` when no window is open; `504 tap_timeout` when no frame arrives |
| `GET /api/v1/qr/tap/close` | release port1 back to stab/detect |

Debug-grade and Star6E-only by construction. These are the experiment
instrument; the shipping surface is a scan-window API that brackets open/close
around a deadline rather than exposing them raw.

## Verification

- `make lint`, then `make verify` (both backends; Maruko must still build with
  the tap absent).
- Device, on a bench with `framing=off` and `detect.enabled=false` so port1 is
  free:
  - **OSD-cleanliness** — with the hub OSD compositing on port0, pull
    `/api/v1/qr/tap.pgm` and `/api/v1/snapshot.jpg` back to back. The HUD must
    appear in the JPEG and be absent from the PGM. This is the experiment the
    whole approach rests on.
  - **Geometry** — set `qr.tapWidth`/`Height` below the main stream and confirm
    the PGM header reports the requested size, i.e. the resolution knob the JPEG
    path cannot offer.
  - **Grab stress** — captures against an open tap, checking for
    `EnsureInputPortFifoEmpty` / MMU faults in `dmesg`. Done: 300/300 grabs
    byte-exact, 0 wedge signatures, no leak (`MemAvailable` 43.9 → 42.1 MB).
    Note decode rate is NOT a tap metric when the marker is handheld — it
    measures presentation. Judge on HTTP failures and `dmesg` only.
  - **Cycle stress — the gating one.** open → grab → close repeatedly *with the
    encoder live*, counting CYCLES not captures. This is the direct analogue of
    what wedged `snapshot.pgm` (~2 per 560 cycles), and it is what decides
    whether window-scoping is viable at all. If it wedges, the choice collapses
    to hold-the-port-forever or do not ship QR alongside detect.
  - **Lifecycle** — pipeline restart and SIGHUP reinit with the tap enabled,
    confirming clean teardown and no stale-fence wedge in the successor. Done:
    both verified with a window open, port never stranded.
  - **A port that enables but does not deliver.** `MI_VPE_SetPortMode` and
    `MI_VPE_EnablePort` both succeed for geometries the SCL will not drive —
    measured, 160x90 enables cleanly and then produces zero frames forever while
    holding port1 against detect and stab. `lt_port_open()` waits up to 1 s for
    a first frame and tears down if none arrives. Deliberately a frame probe and
    not a geometry rule: the SDK constraint is undocumented and the obvious
    guess is wrong, since the working 1920x1080 is not 16-aligned in height.
