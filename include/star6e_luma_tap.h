/*
 * Read-only NV12 luma tap on VPE port1 (Star6E).
 *
 * Exists so a vision consumer (QR scanning) can read frames that are NOT
 * composited with any MI_RGN overlay.  Overlays attach per scaler output port
 * and both debug_osd and waybeam-hub's osd_render target port0, so port0 — and
 * therefore the MJPEG snapshot channel that 1:N-binds to it — carries HUD
 * pixels over anything a marker might occupy.  port1 is a separate scaler
 * output and is clean.
 *
 * Lifecycle: the port is claimed and enabled for the duration of a SCAN WINDOW
 * and released at its end.  Bring-up only arms the tap.  Holding it for the
 * whole pipeline run was measured too expensive — ~186 MB/s of SCL write
 * traffic at 1080p60 and 8-9 points of CPU while idle — and it locks detect and
 * stab out of port1 for nothing when nobody is scanning.
 *
 * Both edges of that cycle are floored, and this is load-bearing.  The retired
 * /api/v1/snapshot.pgm enabled and disabled port1 per HTTP request; DisablePort
 * racing an in-flight mhal buffer wedges the VPE input FIFO, kernel-side.  Two
 * bench boxes took hard panics from /qr/scan followed immediately by /qr/stop,
 * which closes a port that only just came up.  So LT_REOPEN_COOLDOWN_MS floors
 * the gap between opens and LT_MIN_WINDOW_MS floors how long the port stays up,
 * enforced inside lt_port_close() where no path can bypass it.
 *
 * Threading: the reader thread drains EVERY frame at line rate and copies the
 * luma plane out only when a grab is pending, so a slow consumer can never sit
 * between GetBuf and PutBuf.  A supervisor thread — the ONLY thread that opens
 * or closes the port — runs the decode cascade and self-closes the window.
 * grab() is called from HTTP worker threads and is internally serialized.
 */

/* Remember the tap settings without touching the port.  Called at pipeline
 * bring-up so a later open() knows its geometry.  The port is NOT claimed and
 * NOT enabled here: an always-on tap costs ~186 MB/s of SCL write bandwidth at
 * 1080p60 and holds port1 against detect/stab for the whole run, for nothing
 * when no scan is in progress. */

 * EXTEND the one already running.  Extending never touches port state — it only

 *
 * Returns 0, -EBUSY when port1 is held by stab/detect (reported immediately,
 * never queued), -ENODEV when unarmed, -EIO when the SDK refuses the geometry
 * or the enabled port delivers no frame.
 *
 * May block for up to LT_REOPEN_COOLDOWN_MS enforcing the gap between opens.
 *
 * Safe from any thread.  Opening happens on the CALLER's thread, deliberately,
 * so the caller gets the real error instead of a window that dies silently
 * moments later; ctl_lock serializes it against the supervisor, which owns
 * every close.  So no SDK port call is ever concurrent. */
