/*
 * qr_scan — the bounded QR decode cascade, shared by the freestanding
 * tools/qr/qr_decode CLI and the venc daemon's scan-window worker.
 *
 * This file exists so the two never fork.  The cascade's stage order, its
 * thresholds and its outer-frame gating are all measured against the corpus in
 * tools/qr/test-images plus the generated perspective series in
 * tests/test_qr_marker.c; a second copy would drift silently and the drift
 * would only show up as a craft that stops pairing.
 *
 * The caller supplies a tightly packed 8-bit grayscale image (no stride).  The
 * CLI gets one from a JPEG or P5 PGM; the daemon gets one from the VPE port1
 * luma tap.  Image loading deliberately stays OUT of here: it is the only part
 * that needs stb_image, and linking a JPEG decoder into the daemon to feed it
 * pixels it already has in DRAM would be absurd.
 *
 * Memory: peak heap is ~3x W*H plus quirc's fixed region table.  The cascade
 * holds the caller's image, one W*H scratch arena, and quirc's own W*H image
 * (which aliases its pixel buffer at QUIRC_MAX_REGIONS=254 and retains a
 * high-water allocation across passes).  At the Star6E tap's 1080x1080 that is
 * ~3.5 MB against ~44 MB MemAvailable.
