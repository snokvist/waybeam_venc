/*
 * mdns_beacon — announce-only mDNS device beacon for waybeam_venc.
 *
 * Advertises this encoder as a `_waybeam-venc._tcp.local` service so that
 * ground stations and Android clients can discover the device independently
 * of the optional waybeam-hub.  The service type itself is the recognition
 * signal ("an OpenIPC camera running the waybeam encoder"); TXT is kept
 * deliberately minimal — only the waybeam `version` and the wire-schema
 * `proto`.  Everything else (SoC/backend, codec, sidecar port, full serial,
 * hub presence) is left for the consumer to fetch with one GET /api/v1/config
 * after discovery.  Live state (bitrate, fps, mode) is never advertised here.
 *
 * The instance/host name is `waybeam-<suffix>` where <suffix> is the tail of
 * the SoC die ID (device_id.h); see DISCOVERY_TRUST_MIGRATION_SPEC.md §4.5.
 *
 * The beacon runs on its own thread: it does not discover peers, does not
 * feed any trust layer, and never blocks the encode path.  It responds to
 * PTR queries for its own service type and re-announces periodically.
