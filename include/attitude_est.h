/*
 * Complementary-filter attitude estimator (roll/pitch/yaw from a 6-axis
 * IMU sample stream). Feeds the rtp_sidecar ATTITUDE trailer
 * (protocols/rtp-sidecar.md).
 *
 * Convention (sensor frame, aerospace-style): x forward, y right,
 * z down. Roll about x (right-wing-down positive), pitch about y
 * (nose-up positive), yaw about z. Roll/pitch are gravity-referenced
 * via the accelerometer; yaw is pure gyro integration and drifts —
 * relative heading only. Physical mounting differences are corrected
 * by the caller (attitude.mount_deg / invert flags), not here.
 *
 * Pure C, no SDK/IMU dependencies — unit-testable on the host.
