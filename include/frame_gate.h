/* Adaptive frame gate — an overload reflex for the stream VENC channel.
 *
 * When the frame-shm egress ring stops draining, the backend stops draining
 * the encoder's output FIFO, and resumes when the consumer catches up.  No
 * SDK call is made in either direction, and that is the whole design: the
 * intake pause this started as (MI_VENC_StopRecvPic and its per-backend
 * equivalents) emits an IRAP on every resume — measured at one per cycle on
 * Star6E, three on Maruko, 0.6 on CV610 and ~4.6 per second against a real
 * capacity-limited RF link — which is the keyframe the feature exists to
 * avoid.  Letting the FIFO backpressure changes no encoder state at all.
 *
 * There is no enable switch: the gate arms whenever the output is a frame
 * ring, because the ring is the occupancy signal it runs on and no other
 * transport has one.
 *
 * Why a gate and not a rate write.  video0.bitrate is the only proportional
 * rate actuator on the SigmaStar backends and MI_VENC_SetChnAttr implicitly
 * emits an IDR (measured; see the note above apply_bitrate() in
 * src/star6e_controls.c).  Responding to a congested link with a bitrate
 * write therefore injects the largest frame in the stream into an already
 * overflowing link.  No IDR-free *proportional* substitute exists: qpDelta
 * writes s32IPQPDelta and only redistributes bits between I and P, and
 * min_qp is a cliff that abandons CBR rather than a dial (README).  The gate
 * writes neither RC state nor ROI config, so the CBR contract and the ROI
 * QP gradient are both untouched.
 *
 * This module is pure: no SDK types, no I/O, no clock of its own.  The
 * caller supplies ring occupancy and a monotonic timestamp and applies the
 * returned action.  That keeps the policy host-testable and identical
 * across all three backends.
 *
 * Relationship to waybeam-link.  The gate does NOT move rate policy back
 * into the daemon (0.69.0 deliberately moved it out).  It is a local
 * overload reflex acting on a signal and an actuator that both live inside
 * venc and cannot be reached from outside at frame cadence; waybeam-link
 * still owns the rate model and the gate absorbs the transients between its
 * decisions.  See documentation/ADAPTIVE_FRAME_GATE_PLAN.md.

/* Reopen threshold, in slots.  Pinned, not configurable: the ring's healthy
 * idle occupancy is one frame and not zero — the producer samples just after
 * writing — so "<= 1" is the documented healthy band and ">= 2" is standing
 * backlog (include/venc_frame_ring.h).  A different value would not mean
 * "more/less aggressive", it would mean "wrong". */

/* Backstop on how long the gate may stay open after a SAFETY ESCAPE.
 *
 * The escape exists so a dead consumer cannot stop the stream for good: it
 * reopens, lets ONE frame through, and the ring reports full_drops — a
 * diagnosable failure rather than a silent one.  Without something holding it
 * open it cannot even do that: occupancy is still above close_slots at the
 * instant it reopens, so the very next observation closes again, and the gated
 * idle path polls every 1-2 ms while a frame takes 10-33 ms.  Measured
 * 2026-09-12, a dead consumer froze production with every drop counter at
 * zero, under both actuators.
 *
 * The pulse ends on the FIRST frame that actually lands, not after a fixed
 * window — that is what keeps it to about one frame.  Occupancy rising above
 * its level at the escape can only mean a producer write, so the pulse never
 * ends early; what it can miss is a write that a concurrent drain cancels out,
 * which costs one extra frame per drain observed inside the pulse and is
 * capped by the backstop below.  In the regime where escapes actually happen
 * the consumer is by definition slow, so drains inside a sub-millisecond-scale
 * pulse are rare: measured ~1.01 frames per pulse on Maruko at a 5 fps drain.
 *
 * A time-based dwell instead let the drain
 * loop flush the whole buffered backlog into the ring while it was open:
 * measured 2026-09-13 on Maruko at 30 fps production against a 5 fps drain,
 * ~2.9 frames per pulse, which exactly replaced what the consumer took.  The
 * gate then never reached its reopen threshold again — close and escape
 * counters advanced in lockstep — and the ring equilibrated near full, making
 * ring residency the dominant latency term on that board.
 *
 * This constant is only the backstop for the case where the admitted frame
 * never arrives at all (encoder stopped, or the ring is full so the write is
 * dropped).  20 ms is two frame periods at 100 fps.  Normal closes are not
 * debounced by any of this — only the pulse that follows an escape. */
#define FRAME_GATE_ESCAPE_BACKSTOP_US 20000u

/* Depth of the encoder's bitstream buffer, in frames.
 *
 * This is a LATENCY control, not a gate threshold, and it belongs with the
 * gate because the gate is what makes the depth visible.  Measured 2026-09-12
 * on Star6E: while gated, a frame's age at the ring is the buffer depth times
 * the CONSUMER's frame period, so at a 10 fps drain each slot costs ~97 ms —
 * 534 ms at the SDK default of 3, 436 at 2, 341 at 1.  Ungated it is 4.1 ms
 * at every depth, because nothing queues.
 *
 * Each slot also buys one PRODUCER frame period (10 ms at 100 fps) of
 * tolerance to a consumer that stalls, which is why this is 2 and not 1: the
 * recorder shares ch0 in mirror mode and SD flash GC can stall a write, so
 * one slot of headroom is kept.  Dropping to 1 buys ~95 ms more and leaves
 * none.
 *
 * The SDK drops the pending image BEFORE encoding when this buffer is full
 * (MI VENC API v2.12 §1.3.16), so a shallow buffer can cost frames but can
 * never break the reference chain.  It must be set after channel creation and
 * before encoding starts; the SDK advises against changing it live. */
