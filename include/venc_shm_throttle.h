/*
 * Ring-fill bitrate clamp for the frame-shm:// egress transport.
 *
 * Problem this solves.  When the frame ring fills, the producer discards a
 * whole *already-encoded* frame (venc_frame_ring_begin_write returns -1).
 * The drop lands after encode, so the H.265 reference chain breaks and the
 * receiver decodes garbage until the next IDR or the end of the GDR cycle.
 * The v0.9.2 post-encode frame skip was reverted for exactly this reason —
 * dropping frames is not a backpressure strategy, it is the damage.
 *
 * The ring is 8 slots x 384 KB.  At 100 fps that is 80 ms of queue, so by
 * the time it is *full* the stream has already blown its latency budget.
 * Occupancy, not the drop counter, is the control variable.
 *
 * Authority split.  This clamp owns instantaneous safety on a ~200 ms
 * timescale; an external rate controller (waybeam-link) keeps sole
 * ownership of steady-state rate on a 1.5-8 s timescale.  The clamp is a
 * multiplier applied to whatever bitrate was configured — it NEVER writes
 * video0.bitrate.  Consequences that fall out of that: an external
 * controller's write-on-change cache stays coherent (every write still
 * succeeds and lands in config), the WebUI slider and curl stay truthful,
 * and any number of controllers compose with it, because a clamp is
 * idempotent.  Returning an error from the setter instead would have made
 * a write-on-change controller re-push the same value forever.
 *
 * Cascade stability: the 200 ms window must stay >=5x faster than the
 * slowest external actuator loop (currently ~1500 ms settle, so ~10x).
 * That inner/outer separation is what keeps the two controllers from
 * coupling into oscillation.  Preserve it if you retune either side.
 *
 * Control law (AIMD, evaluated on each window's high-water mark):
 *   used_slots >= ENGAGE_SLOTS   -> permille = max(FLOOR, permille * 4/5)
 *   full_drops increased         -> permille = max(FLOOR, permille * 3/5)
 *                                   immediately, without waiting for the
 *                                   window to close (a drop is proof, not
 *                                   a prediction)
 *   used_slots <= RECOVER_SLOTS  -> permille = min(1000, permille + 50)
 *
 * Multiplicative-decrease / additive-increase, so recovery is deliberately
 * slower than the retreat: 1000 -> floor takes 7 windows (~1.4 s), floor ->
 * 1000 takes 15 windows (~3.0 s).  The 250 floor means a wedged consumer
 * cannot drive the encoder to nothing.
 *
 * Policy is compile-time, following include/idr_rate_limit.h.  The single
 * runtime knob is outgoing.shm_throttle (bool).  Exposing high/low water
 * marks as config was tried in v0.9.2 and removed as "more noise than
 * useful"; that judgement has not changed.
 *
 * No SDK dependency, no syscalls, no clock of its own — the caller passes
 * now_us.  Pure and host-unit-testable; see tests/test_venc_shm_throttle.c.
 *
 * Threading: one instance per output, owned by the pipeline thread that
 * writes the ring.  Not internally synchronised and does not need to be.
