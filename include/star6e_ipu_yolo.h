/*
 * Star6E IPU YOLO detection — host side.
 *
 * Adds a VPE port1 tap (NV12, model input size) feeding a detector backend
 * (see detect_plugin.h) on a dedicated reader thread.  The backend owns the
 * IPU device + decode; in Phase A the "worker" backend also draws its own
 * MI_RGN overlay, so enabling detection puts boxes on the encoded stream with
 * no host-side overlay work.
 *
 * Port1 is a single physical VPE output shared with the stab framing tap, so
 * detection and framing=stab are mutually exclusive — the caller must only
 * start detection when no port1-owning framing module is active.
