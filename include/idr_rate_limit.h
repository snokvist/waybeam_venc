/*
 * Per-VENC-channel IDR rate limiter.
 *
 * IDR (keyframe) requests originate from several unrelated producers:
 * scene detector, HTTP API (/api/v1/idr, /api/v1/dual/idr), recorder
 * start, controls-apply paths.  Without coordination a bug-driven burst
 * (for example a mis-tuned scene threshold during a camera pan) can
 * crater per-frame bitrate by back-to-back forced keyframes.  This
 * module enforces a minimum spacing between honored IDRs per channel;
 * requests inside the lockout window are silently coalesced and counted
 * in a rate-limited counter.
 *
 * Policy is compile-time:
 *   IDR_RATE_LIMIT_MIN_SPACING_US = 100000 (100 ms)
 *
 * 100 ms at 120 fps = 12 frames between honored IDRs, well above the
 * sensible scene-cooldown floor and well below the typical GOP period
 * (≈83 ms at GOP=10) — so auto-GOP IDRs are unaffected (they're not
 * RequestIdr-driven), forced IDRs coalesce when fired in a storm.
 *
 * Thread-safety: per-channel `last_us` is updated via a CAS loop so
 * exactly one concurrent caller wins each spacing window; the rest see
 * the updated `last_us` on retry and drop into the rate-limited branch.
 * Counters are atomic-increment.  No mutex required.

 * idr_rate_limit_allow() reports a coalesced request as success.
 *
 * A bootstrap IDR is a different event.  Output enable, a destination change,
 * a live fps rebind and recorder start all hand the stream — or a freshly
 * opened file — to a receiver that has seen no parameter set at all, so a coalesced request leaves it with NOTHING to
 * start from until the next GOP or GDR cycle — and the caller was told the
 * apply succeeded.  These must not be swallowed.
 *
 * Counted as honored like every other source (the /api/v1/idr/stats parity
 * claim depends on it) and re-arms the spacing window, so an ordinary request
 * arriving right behind a bootstrap still coalesces against it. */
