/*
 * Star6E userspace AWB loop.
 *
 * The i6e ISP-internal AWB does not converge under this pipeline: it latches
 * whatever it estimated in the first second and never moves again (on IMX335 a
 * standing yellow cast).  The SDK's own userspace-3A stack does converge, but
 * it runs per frame and pins the CPU at 120fps — measured 100% busy, box
 * unusable.  See HISTORY 0.56.0.
 *
 * So AWB is handed to userspace (Cus3AEnable_t.bAWB = 1) and driven from here
 * instead, at a rate WE choose:
 *
 *     MI_ISP_AWB_GetAwbHwAvgStats  — 128x90 block R/G/B averages, already
 *                                    computed by hardware, free to read
 *     grey-world + block rejection — a few hundred microseconds
 *     MI_ISP_CUS3A_SetAwbParam     — apply
 *
 * Because nothing here is per-frame, the cost is independent of frame rate:
 * 120fps costs exactly what 60fps costs.  That is the whole point.
 *
 * Threading: one thread, started/stopped with the pipeline.  All SDK calls are
 * made from that thread only.
