/* Runtime IQ control for the Hi3516CV610 ISP.
 *
 * PR #229 seeded this ISP through the IMX662 sensor plugin's
 * cmos_get_isp_default(), which the ISP reads once at pipe start.  This
 * module exposes the same blocks as live knobs, so a value can be corrected
 * without a cross-compile and a reboot.
 *
 * Unlike star6e_iq.c there is no dlopen: the CV610 backend links ss_mpi
 * directly, so the attribute structs are the SDK's own types and the field
 * table is built from offsetof() rather than hand-computed offsets. */
