 * AF_UNIX SOCK_DGRAM blocks on the *receiver's* queue depth, which the
 * kernel snapshots from this sysctl when the receiving socket is created.
 * The kernel default of 10 datagrams is roughly 7 ms of buffer at 15 Mbps
 * with 1400-byte RTP payloads — less than one frame at 60 fps, so every
 * frame overruns it and the encode thread stalls waiting on consumer
 * scheduling.  256 gives ~180 ms at 15 Mbps, which absorbs ordinary
 * scheduling jitter without the send path ever blocking.
 *
 * The producer cannot fix this for a consumer that is already running --
 * raising the sysctl only affects sockets created afterwards.  It has to
 * be raised at boot (see init.d/S95waybeam); we only warn. */

 * to have the function read SO_SNDBUF live via getsockopt — useful for
 * cold paths, tests, and recovery when the open-time capture failed; the
 * hot path should always pass the cached struct to keep this to a single
 * SIOCOUTQ syscall per call.
 *
 * For udp:// the denominator is the kernel-reported SO_SNDBUF.
 *
 * For unix:// the binding limit is the receiver's queue depth, not the
 * sender's SO_SNDBUF, and the sender cannot read the receiver's depth.
 * So the denominator is `queue->unix_capacity` once a send has actually
 * saturated the queue (exact), falling back to an estimate from the
 * max_dgram_qlen sysctl before that has ever happened (approximate, and
 * wrong whenever the sysctl changed after the consumer started).
 *
 * Linux reports SO_SNDBUF as 2× the requested size (the doubling is
 * internal kernel bookkeeping); both queued and sndbuf use the same
 * units, so the ratio is correct without correcting the doubling.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success and writes 0..100 into *out_pct.  Returns -1
 * for fd < 0 or any of the syscalls failing.  On UDP the queue drains
 * fast (kernel hands to NIC) so values >0 are rare in steady state;
